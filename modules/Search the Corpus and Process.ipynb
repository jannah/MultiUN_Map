        "<h1>COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS Sixty-second session Item 11 (b) of the provisional agenda</h1><p>CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE QUESTIONS OF:</p><h1>Report of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances</h1><h1>Summary</h1><p>Established by resolution 20 (XXXVI) of 29 February 1980 of the Commission on Human Rights, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances was the first United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a global mandate. Since its inception, the Working Group has transmitted more than 50,000 individual cases to Governments in more than 90 countries.</p><p>In the present report, the Working Group expresses serious concern regarding situations of disappearance worldwide. It notes with great concern the large number of reports of disappearances transmitted over the last year. During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted to Governments in 22 countries 535 newly reported cases of disappearances. During the same period, the Working Group clarified 1,309 cases in 17 countries, a considerable increase over previous years. This is due in large measure to an enhanced capacity of the Secretariat to address a backlog of unprocessed cases, in particular from Sri Lanka.</p><p>During the reporting period, the Working Group conducted a country visit to Colombia. The report of the country visit to Colombia is an addendum to this report. It contains an overview of the constitutional and legal framework on disappearances, including developments since the last visit of the Working Group in 1988. It highlights the gap between a sophisticated legal system and the poor concrete results of legal mechanisms designed to address the crime of disappearance. The Working Group makes general and specific recommendations to halt the continuing pattern of disappearances in the country, to protect the families of victims and non-governmental organizations working to discover the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons, to address the problem of underreporting of cases of disappearance, to align domestic legislation with the States' obligation under the Declaration on the Protection of the Rights of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, and to more effectively implement the existing legal mechanisms on disappearances in Colombia.</p><p>The Working Group is still particularly concerned about reports it has received of the disappearance of children and, in a few cases, of physically and mentally challenged persons. The Working Group recalls the obligation of States to protect all groups in situations of vulnerability. It will continue to monitor this issue closely, and treat all such cases as a matter of urgency.</p><p>The protection of all human rights defenders, families seeking their disappeared relatives, witnesses and legal counsel is also a constant preoccupation of the Working Group. States are reminded of their obligation under article 13, paragraph 3, of the Declaration to protect against \"ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal\" all persons involved in the investigation of disappearances.</p><p>The Working Group again stresses its grave concern that anti-terrorist activities are being used by an increasing number of States as an excuse for not respecting the obligations of the Declaration. Credible reports point to the repression of opposition groups in many States in the name of a \"war on terror\". In addition \"extraordinary rendition\" has been used to transport terrorist suspects to other States for aggressive interrogation. Information continues to reach the Working Group concerning the existence of secret detention centres where terrorist suspects are held in complete isolation from the outside world. In all three situations, people disappear. As is well documented, disappearance is often a precursor to torture and even to extrajudicial execution.</p><p>The Working Group notes that in some post-conflict situations, mechanisms of truth and reconciliation are being used as one of the ways of moving the affected societies from war to peace and from conflict to post-conflict government. The Working Group expresses its concern that such circumstances can give rise to the enactment of amnesty laws and the implementation of other measures that lead to the same result: impunity. As a response to this concern, during the seventy-seventh session of the Working Group, it adopted a general comment on article 18 of the Declaration in an effort to contribute to the progressive development of international law on this sensitive matter.</p><h1>Paragraphs Page</h1><h1>The mandate 1 - 3 9</h1><h1>Disappearance as a global problem 4 - 8 9</h1><h1>C.

This resolution followed General Assembly resolution 33/173 of 20 December 1978 entitled \"Disappeared persons\", in which the General Assembly expressed concern over reports from various parts of the world relating to enforced disappearance. The Working Group was the first United Nations human rights thematic mechanism to be established with a universal mandate.</p><p>Elaboration on the Working Group's mandate was provided in General Assembly resolution 47/133 of 18 December 1992, entitled \"Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance\" and most recently by the Commission on Human Rights in resolution 2004/40 of 19 April 2004. These instruments gave the Working Group the primary responsibility of working to secure compliance of member States with those international humanitarian principles, norms and provisions on protecting all persons from enforced or involuntary disappearances.</p><p>In addition to the core mandate, the Working Group has also been entrusted, according to Commission resolution 2004/40, with the task of monitoring the progress of States in fulfilling obligations derived from the Declaration.</p><h1>Disappearance as a global problem</h1><p>Although the Working Group was initially formed to address the legacy of disappearance arising from authoritarian rule in Latin America, disappearance has now become a global problem not restricted to a specific region. The more common pattern today is that large-scale disappearances occur in States suffering from internal conflict, as in the case of Colombia, Nepal, the Russian Federation, Iraq, and the Sudan. In other countries political repression of opponents has resulted in hundreds of cases of disappearance. Countries such as Algeria and the Philippines may be mentioned in this regard. In some cases such as the Islamic Republic of Iran, radical political changes have created conditions that led to hundreds of cases of disappearance. There are also countries that carry the burden of their past, with thousands of cases that still await clarification after decades, as in Argentina and Chile, and some countries in Central America.</p><p>In certain situations, due to probable underreporting of disappearances especially but not uniquely in Africa, the Working Group expects that large numbers of reports of disappearance arising from current conflicts could be submitted to it during the coming years. The Working Group has highlighted such situations in its present report.</p><p>Among the general factors found by the Working Group to account for the underreporting of disappearance cases are poverty, illiteracy, submissiveness to fatalism, fear of reprisal, weakness of administration of justice, ineffectual reporting channels and mechanisms, institutionalized systems of impunity, and a practice of silence. There may also be particular factors promoting the underreporting of the phenomenon of disappearance in given countries or regions.</p><p>The Working Group is concerned that underreporting of disappearance in certain regions and countries is also due to restrictions on the work of civil society on this sensitive issue. It is difficult to receive information from some parts of the world in which there are many indications that human rights violations, including disappearances, have taken and are still taking place. Unfortunately, in some regions non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are not numerous and organized enough to be able to work effectively on disappearances. Nevertheless the Working Group continues to receive positive information on the development of a network of associations of families of victims and NGOs that may be able to deal with this issue in the future.</p><p>In the context of internal armed conflict, opposition forces have reportedly perpetrated disappearances. While the mandate of the Working Group is limited to violations carried out by State agents or non-State actors acting with the connivance of the State, the Working Group condemns the practice of disappearance irrespective of who the perpetrators may be.</p><h1>C. The way we work</h1><p>The primary task of the Working Group is to clarify the fate or whereabouts of persons who are reported to have disappeared.2 The Working Group serves as a channel of communication between sources of information on alleged disappearances - typically family members or NGOs - and Governments. The Working Group does not establish criminal liability nor does it declare State responsibility. Its mandate is essentially humanitarian. Since its inception the Working Group has transmitted more than 50,000 individual cases to Governments in more than 90 countries. Though clarifying the fate of disappeared persons is a difficult task, the Working Group, through its continuing contact with Governments and NGOs, whose work on the question of disappearances has been essential, strives to help the victims of disappearances, including the persons directly concerned and their family members.</p><p>The crime of enforced disappearance, as defined in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, is a continuous crime until the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person becomes known. For that reason, a disappearance remains under active consideration by the Working Group until the case is clarified. Once received from a source, a case is transmitted to a Government with a request for a response. Cases that occurred within the three months preceding receipt by the Working Group are treated as \"urgent actions\" and are transmitted immediately to the country concerned. It is common for the Working Group to facilitate successive exchanges of information between the source and the Government. Any governmental reply containing detailed information on the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person is transmitted to the source. If under normal circumstances the source does not respond within six months of the date on which the reply was communicated to it, or if it contests the Government's information on grounds that are considered to be unreasonable by the Working Group, the case is considered clarified, hereafter referred to as the \"six-month rule\".</p><p>The Working Group also takes \"prompt intervention\" actions in connection with acts of intimidation, persecution or reprisal against relatives of missing persons and private individuals or groups who seek to discover the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons, to uncover the causes of disappearances, or to claim redress. \"Prompt intervention\" letters are sent to the Government concerned with the appeal that it take immediate steps to protect all the fundamental rights of the persons affected.</p><p>Appeals made to the Working Group do not restrict simultaneous use of international or regional treaty-based human rights petition procedures.</p><p>In addition to dealing with individual cases of disappearance, the Working Group also reports upon \"general allegations\". These general allegations derive from information provided by credible non-governmental organizations and by associations of families of the disappeared with which the Working Group is in regular contact. The Working Group simply transmits the general allegations to Governments for their comment and response. This year, the general allegations were transmitted to Governments in June, allowing five months for a response.</p><h1>The present report</h1><p>In the period under review, the Working Group decided to adopt a new format for reporting to the Commission on Human Rights. Apart from the minor structural changes reflected in the Introduction and Conclusions, the most significant contribution in this new system of reporting is in the information regarding specific countries.</p><p>For the first time, a tabular summary of relevant information is provided for each State. Under the prior system, where the Working Group had not received any information regarding a particular country, the report would contain no information on that country, even though the Working Group still had outstanding cases. In this year's report, the Working Group has decided to include every country which has outstanding cases before the Working Group. Therefore, as far as country reports are concerned, this report has three main categories. The first one refers to countries about which information was provided, either by the source or by the Government, on any of the outstanding cases before the Working Group. If urgent actions or prompt interventions or general allegations were transmitted to the Governments, the report shows that information. The second category refers to countries where no new information was received by the Working Group during the year under consideration. In this case, the report provides the information that the Working Group has in its files and therefore reports that no new information was received. The third category refers to a few States that have never responded to the Working Group's requests for information about the cases that have been reported and remain outstanding.</p><p>The Working Group decided to implement this new system to give a more complete attention to all countries where disappearances have been reported to the Working Group. This is an additional step of the Working Group to make its work more efficient and effective. This is particularly important in relation to countries with a large number of unresolved cases that have not communicated on a regular basis with the Working Group, or where, even if they do communicate regularly, the information provided is unsubstantial or seems to be \"pro forma\", with no relevant additional information. For certain countries referred to in this report, the Working Group extends invitations to Governments to meet the Working Group at any of its sessions to take place during 2006.</p><p>The present report of the Working Group is submitted pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/27. Since its creation in 1980, the Working Group has submitted a report annually to the Commission on Human Rights, starting at the Commission's thirty-seventh session. As in the past, the report reflects only communications or cases examined prior to the last day of the third annual session of the Working Group, namely 30 November 2005. Those responses from Governments reviewed after that date, as well as urgent actions subsequently transmitted, will be reflected in the next report of the Working Group. In respect of newly reported cases transmitted by the Working Group after 15 September 2005, it must be understood that the Governments concerned may not have been able to respond prior to the adoption of the present report.</p><p>The total number of cases transmitted by the Working Group to Governments since the Working Group's inception is now 51,236. The total number of cases under active consideration that have not yet been clarified or discontinued stands at 41,128 and concerns 79 States. Over the past five years, the Working Group has been able to clarify 7,087 cases.</p><p>The additional Secretariat staffing provided in 2004 permitted the Working Group to continue addressing a backlog of cases. Over the last year, the Working Group managed to transmit all of the pending responses from the Government of Sri Lanka to sources in that country. The Working Group is pleased with the significant progress made in addressing this issue and expects further progress in 2006. However, the Working Group hopes that the ongoing regularization of posts undertaken by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights will not adversely affect the stability of staffing within the Working Group over the course of the next few years.</p><h1>E. Areas of particular concern this year</h1><p>The Working Group is still particularly concerned about reports it has received of the disappearance of children and, in a few cases, of physically and mentally challenged persons. The Working Group recalls the obligation of States to protect all groups in situations of vulnerability. It will continue to monitor this issue closely, and treat all such cases as a matter of urgency.</p><p>The protection of all human rights defenders, families seeking their disappeared relatives, witnesses, and legal counsel is also a constant preoccupation of the Working Group. States are reminded of their obligation under article 13 (3) of the Declaration to protect against \"ill-treatment, intimidation or reprisal\" all persons involved in the investigation of disappearances.</p><p>The Working Group again stresses its grave concern that anti-terrorist activities are being used by an increasing number of States as an excuse for not respecting the obligations of the Declaration. Credible reports point to the repression of opposition groups in many States in the name of a \"war on terror\". In addition \"extraordinary rendition\" has been used to transport terrorist suspects to other States for aggressive interrogation. Information continues to reach the Working Group on the existence of secret detention centres where terrorist suspects are held in complete isolation from the outside world. In all three situations, people disappear. As is well documented, disappearance is often a precursor to torture and even to extrajudicial execution.</p><p>The Working Group notes that in some post-conflict situations, mechanisms of truth and reconciliation are being employed as one of the ways of moving the affected societies from war to peace and from conflict to post-conflict government. The Working Group expresses its concern that such circumstances can give rise to the enactment of amnesty laws and the implementation of other measures that lead to the same result: impunity. As a response to this concern, during its seventy-seventh session, the Working Group adopted a general comment on article 18 of the Declaration in an effort to contribute to the progressive development of international law on this sensitive matter (see section II.E.2).</p><h1>Meetings and cases</h1><p>During the period under review, the Working Group held three sessions. The seventy-fifth session was held in Bangkok from 26 May to 3 June, the seventy-sixth session was an e-meeting, which considered only individual cases, and the seventy-seventh session was held in Geneva from 21 to 30 November 2005.</p><p>The following members of the Working Group participated in all sessions: Mr. Stephen J. Toope, Chairman-Rapporteur; Mr. J. `Bayo Adekanye, Vice-Chairman-Rapporteur; Mr. Saied Rajaie Khorasani, Mr. Darko Gottlicher, and Mr. Santiago Corcuera.</p><p>The Working Group has adopted the practice that its members will not attend meetings of the Working Group when issues related to the country of their nationality are discussed.</p><p>During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted for the first time 535 cases of disappearance in 22 countries, 91 of which allegedly occurred during the last year. As in previous years, the Working Group has used an urgent action procedure for 132 cases that allegedly occurred within the three months preceding the receipt of the report by the Group. During the reporting period, the Working Group clarified 1,347 cases of enforced disappearance and discontinued 3 cases.</p><p>During the period under review, the Working Group met formally with representatives of the Governments of Japan, Morocco and Guatemala. The Group also met with representatives of human rights organizations, associations of relatives of disappeared persons and families or witnesses directly concerned with reports of enforced disappearance.</p><p>During the sixty-first session of the Commission and while in Geneva for Working Group meetings, the Chairman-Rapporteur, Stephen Toope, met with NGOs from Africa, Asia, and North and South America, working on specific country situations. He also met with representatives of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Humanist Committee on Human Rights, the International Commission of Jurists and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues. In addition, Mr. Toope met with the Ambassadors of Algeria, India and the Russian Federation to discuss possible country visits. Mr. Toope also met with a delegation from the Government of Yemen and with a consultant to the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission to discuss the clarification of cases.</p><h1>Communications</h1><p>During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted 535 new cases of enforced or involuntary disappearance to the Governments of Algeria, China, Colombia, the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, France, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nepal, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Serbia and Montenegro, the Sudan, Thailand, Tunisia and Uzbekistan.</p><p>The Working Group sent 132 of these cases under the urgent action procedure to the Governments of China, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nepal, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, the Sudan, Tunisia and Uzbekistan.</p><p>Of the newly reported cases, 91 allegedly occurred in 2005, and relate to China, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nepal, the Philippines, the Russian Federation, the Sudan, Tunisia and Uzbekistan.</p><p>During the same period, the Working Group clarified 1,347 cases in the following countries: Burkina Faso, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Guatemala, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Morocco, Nepal, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey and Yemen.</p><p>During the period under review, the Working Group joined with other special procedures mandate holders to issue 15 joint Urgent Actions sent to the Governments of Algeria, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nepal, the Russian Federation and the Sudan.</p><p>As in previous years, the Working Group received reports and expressions of concern from NGOs, associations of relatives of disappeared persons and individuals about the safety of persons actively engaged in the search for missing persons, in reporting cases of disappearance or in the investigation of cases. In some countries, the mere act of reporting a disappearance entailed a serious risk to the life or security of the person making the report, or to his or her family members. In addition, individuals, relatives of disappeared persons and members of human rights organizations were frequently harassed and threatened with death for reporting cases of human rights violations or investigating such cases.</p><p>In 2005, the Working Group sent eight prompt intervention communications addressing the harassment of and threats to human rights defenders and relatives of disappeared persons in Algeria, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Rwanda and Thailand.</p><h1>C. Country visits</h1><p>At the invitation of the Government of Colombia, the Vice-Chairman-Rapporteur, J. `Bayo Adekanye, and Working Group member Santiago Corcuera visited Colombia from 5 to 13 July 2005. These Working Group members visited Bogota, Barrancabermeja and Medellin. They met with high-ranking officials, local authorities and representatives of the army and the police, as well as with NGOs and families of the disappeared.</p><p>The report of the country visit to Colombia is an addendum to this report. It contains an overview of the constitutional and legal framework on disappearances, including developments since the last visit of the Working Group in 1988. It highlights the gap between a sophisticated legal system and the poor concrete results of legal mechanisms designed to address the crime of disappearance. The Working Group makes general and specific recommendations to halt the continuing pattern of disappearances in the country, to protect the families of victims and NGOs working to discover the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons, to address the problem of underreporting of cases of disappearance, to align domestic legislation with the State's obligation under the Declaration, and to more effectively implement the existing legal mechanisms on disappearances in Colombia.</p><p>The Working Group has requested visits to Algeria, Argentina, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Morocco, the Russian Federation and the Sudan. The Working Group will visit Argentina in November 2006, immediately after holding its working session in Buenos Aires. The Russian Federation has agreed in principle to a country visit in 2007, the dates to be confirmed. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran had agreed to a visit by the Working Group in 2005, which was delayed at the request of the Government. New dates for the visit must be agreed. The Working Group is discussing possible country visits with diplomatic representatives of India and Morocco. Regretfully, up to now, the Government of Algeria has not responded to the interest expressed by the Working Group to visit the country.</p><h1>Participation in the intersessional working group to draft a legally binding instrument for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance</h1><p>Over the course of the last two years, four members of the Working Group have participated in meetings of the intersessional working group to draft a legally binding instrument for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearances. Mr. Adekanye and Mr. Toope attended in January 2004, and formally raised certain key issues for the attention of States. Mr. Gottlicher attended in October 2004, and Mr. Corcuera in February 2005, sharing information about the working methods of the Working Group and informally suggesting drafting approaches. Mr. Toope attended the last negotiating and drafting session in September 2005 and intervened to draw the attention of States to important normative issues to be addressed in the draft instrument. The Working Group welcomes the conclusion of the draft convention on enforced disappearance and congratulates all the associations of families of the disappeared who worked tirelessly to promote a binding treaty on disappearances.</p><h1>E. Statements, studies and general comments</h1><p>The Chairman-Rapporteur attended the meeting of the special procedures in June 2005 and joined in the concluding statement.</p><p>In addition, Mr. Toope joined with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to issue a statement on the September 2005 referendum in Algeria on peace and reconciliation. The two experts expressed the hope that in pursuing national reconciliation the right of victims of disappearance to truth and reparations would be fully acknowledged and implemented.</p><p>For the International Day of the Disappeared, a press release was issued on 26 August 2005 on behalf of the Working Group expressing its concern about the phenomenon of disappearance in various parts of the world. It also expressed its solidarity with all those who suffer from enforced disappearance and with human rights defenders working for disappeared persons and their relatives.</p><p>The Working Group issued a statement on 23 September 2005 welcoming the conclusion of the drafting of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and congratulating the Chairperson of the drafting group, the States that participated in the negotiations, and the NGOs and collectives of families of the disappeared who worked to ensure a successful outcome to the negotiations.</p><p>Mr. Toope also delivered an expert statement at the conference \"The global struggle against torture\", co-sponsored by Amnesty International and Reprieve and held in London from 19 to 21 November 2005.</p><h1>Comparative study on the criminal law treatment of enforced or involuntary disappearances</h1><p>At its seventh-fifth session, the Working Group decided to commission a comparative study on the criminal law treatment of enforced or involuntary disappearances in States around the globe. Article 4 of the Declaration requires that States treat all acts of enforced disappearance as \"offences under criminal law punishable by appropriate penalties which shall take into account their extreme seriousness\".</p><p>The Working Group sent a note verbale inviting all Governments to provide information concerning the treatment of enforced or involuntary disappearances within their national law. Of the 18 Governments which responded to the invitation, many provided very detailed information. The full study will be released in 2006.</p><p>Preliminary analysis reveals that outside of Latin America, very few States have created a specific criminal offence of enforced or involuntary disappearances. In total, only eight countries have created a separate offence. Of these, only one is outside of Latin America.</p><h1>General comment on article 18 of the Declaration</h1><p>The problem of impunity for disappearances has long troubled the Working Group. For many years the creation of truth commissions and other mechanisms of peace and reconciliation, and the possibility of amnesty and pardon in a number of States have generated heated debate within countries and internationally. At its seventy-fourth session, the Working Group invited a member to prepare a short paper on this issue. The paper was thoroughly debated by the Working Group at its seventy-fifth session. In November 2005, at its seventy-seventh session, the Working Group adopted the following general comment on article 18 of the Declaration:</p><p>\"Disappearances, amnesty and impunity: general comment on article 18 of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance</p><p>\"Preamble</p><p>\"The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances has long been concerned with the effects of legal measures that result in amnesties and pardons, as well as mitigating measures or similar provisions that lead to impunity for gross violations of human rights, including disappearance. In its 1994 report (E/CN.4/1994/26) the Working Group specifically referred to the question of impunity, reminding States of their obligations not to make or enact laws that would in effect give immunity to perpetrators of disappearances. Subsequent reports have repeated this concern.</p><p>\"The Working Group has followed closely the development of international human rights law regarding impunity. The Working Group bears in mind the contents of the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity, and recalls the provisions of article 15 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the several decisions of the Human Rights Committee and of the Inter-American Commission and Court of Human Rights on the question of amnesties, and the reports and independent studies on the question of impunity prepared for the United Nations human rights system by independent experts.</p><p>\"In its resolutions, particularly 57/215, entitled `Question of enforced or involuntary disappearances', the General Assembly encouraged the Working Group to `continue to consider the question of impunity, in the light of the relevant provisions of the Declaration and of the final reports submitted by the special rapporteurs appointed by the Subcommission'. The Working Group decided at its seventy-fourth session that it would examine issues related to amnesties and impunity at its following sessions.</p><p>\"The Working Group has decided to issue the following general comment on what it determines to be the proper interpretation of article 18 of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance:</p><p>\"General comment</p><p>\"1. Article 18 of the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance (hereafter referred to as the `Declaration') should be interpreted in conjunction with other articles of the Declaration. Therefore, States should refrain from making or enacting amnesty laws that would exempt the perpetrators of enforced disappearance from criminal proceedings and sanctions, and also prevent the proper application and implementation of other provisions of the Declaration.</p><p>\"2. An amnesty law should be considered as being contrary to the provisions of the Declaration even where endorsed by a referendum or similar consultation procedure, if, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of its application or implementation, it results in any or all of the following:</p><p>\"(a) Ending the State's obligations to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for disappearances, as provided for in articles 4, 13, 14 and 16 of the Declaration;</p><p>\"(b) Preventing, impeding or hindering the granting of adequate indemnification, rehabilitation, compensation and reparation as a result of the enforced disappearances, as provided for in article 19 of the Declaration;</p><p>\"(c) Concealing the names of the perpetrators of disappearance, thereby violating the right to truth and information, which can be inferred from articles 4 (2) and 9 of the Declaration;</p><p>\"(d) Exonerating the perpetrators of disappearance, treating them as if they had not committed such an act, and therefore have no obligation to indemnify the victim, in contravention of articles 4 and 18 of the Declaration;</p><p>\"(e) Dismissing criminal proceedings or closing investigations against alleged perpetrators of disappearances or imposing insignificant sanctions in order to give the perpetrators the benefit of the right not to be tried twice for the same crime which would in fact result in impunity, thereby violating article 4 (1) of the Declaration;</p><p>\"3. The following are examples of `similar measures' which, even if not contained in an amnesty law, should be considered contrary to the Declaration:</p><p>\"(a) Suspension or cessation of an investigation into disappearance on the basis of failure or inability to identify the possible perpetrators, in contravention of article 13 (6) of the Declaration;</p><p>\"(b) Making the victim's right to truth, information, redress, reparation, rehabilitation, or compensation conditional on the withdrawal of charges or the granting of pardon to the alleged perpetrators of the disappearance;</p><p>\"(c) Application of statutory limitations that are short or that commence even as the crime of disappearance is still ongoing, given the continuing nature of the crime, thereby breaching articles 4 and 17 of the Declaration;</p><p>\"(d) Application of any statutory limitation when the practice of disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity;</p><p>\"(e) Putting perpetrators on trial as part of a scheme to acquit them or impose insignificant sanctions, which would in fact amount to impunity.</p><p>\"4. Notwithstanding the above, article 18 of the Declaration, when construed together with other provisions of the Declaration, allows limited and exceptional measures that directly lead to the prevention and termination of disappearances, as provided for in article 3 of the Declaration, even if, prima facie, these measures could appear to have the effect of an amnesty law or similar measure that might result in impunity.</p><p>\"5. Indeed, in States where systematic or massive violations of human rights have occurred as a result of internal armed conflict or political repression, legislative measures that could lead to finding the truth and reconciliation through pardon might be the only option to terminate or prevent disappearances.</p><p>\"6. Although mitigating circumstances may, at first glance, appear to amount to measures that could lead to impunity, they are allowed under article 4 (2) of the Declaration in two specific cases, i.e. when they lead to bringing the victims forward alive or to obtaining information that would contribute to establishing the fate of the disappeared person.</p><p>\"7. Also, the granting of pardon is expressly permitted under article 18 (2) of the Declaration, as long as in its exercise the extreme seriousness of acts of disappearance is taken into account.</p><p>\"8. Therefore, in exceptional circumstances, when States consider it necessary to enact laws aimed to elucidate the truth and to terminate the practice of enforced disappearance, such laws may be compatible with the Declaration as long as such laws are within the following limits:</p><p>\"(a) Criminal sanctions should not be completely eliminated, even if imprisonment is excluded by the law. Within the framework of pardon or of the application of mitigating measures, reasonable alternative criminal sanctions (i.e. payment of compensation, community work, etc.) should always be applicable to the persons who would otherwise have been subject to imprisonment for having perpetrated the crime of disappearance;</p><p>\"(b) Pardon should only be granted after a genuine peace process or bona fide negotiations with the victims have been carried out, resulting in apologies and expressions of regret from the State or the perpetrators, and guarantees to prevent disappearances in the future;</p><p>\"(c) Perpetrators of disappearances shall not benefit from such laws if the State has not fulfilled its obligations to investigate the relevant circumstances surrounding disappearances, identify and detain the perpetrators, and ensure the satisfaction of the right to justice, truth, information, redress, reparation, rehabilitation and compensation to the victims. Truth and reconciliation procedures should not prevent the parallel functioning of special prosecution and investigation procedures regarding disappearances;</p><p>\"(d) In States that have gone through deep internal conflicts, criminal investigations and prosecutions may not be displaced by, but can run parallel to, carefully designed truth and reconciliation processes;</p><p>\"(e) The law should clearly aim, with appropriate implementing mechanisms, to effectively achieve genuine and sustainable peace and to grant the victims guarantees of termination and non-repetition of the practice of disappearance.\"</p><h1>Afghanistan</h1><h1>Information from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>Of the two cases of disappearance reported to the Working Group in the past one concerned a Jordanian journalist who allegedly disappeared in 1989 in Jalalabad, Nangarhar Province, and another concerned a citizen of the United States of Afghan origin who allegedly disappeared in 1993. A third case, from 2003, concerned a prominent elder of the \"Kuchi tribe\" in eastern Afghanistan, who was allegedly arrested by the United States military forces on his way to a meeting with President Karzai regarding a tribal dispute.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted three cases to the Government; of those, none has been clarified, and three cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observation</h1><p>The Working Group invites the Government of Afghanistan to provide information which could lead to the clarification of the outstanding cases.</p><h1>Algeria</h1><h1>Standard cases</h1><p>The Working Group transmitted 253 newly reported cases of disappearance in Algeria. The majority of these cases involved persons who reportedly disappeared between 1993 and 1997 and concerned a wide variety of persons from across Algerian society and included children, women and elderly people.</p><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review, no information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>During the period under review, no information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Prompt intervention</h1><p>On 27 April 2005, the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers sent a joint urgent action communication concerning the issue of the referendum of 29 September 2005 on Decree No. 05-278 on peace and national reconciliation and its effects on the relatives of disappeared persons. In this communication, the mandate holders expressed concern that a subsequent amnesty might apply to those persons responsible for human rights violations during the Algerian conflict in the mid-1990s. The mandate holders welcomed the recognition by the Algerian authorities that more than 6,146 cases of disappearance had occurred during that period, but expressed their doubts about the statement of a government official that such a large number of cases had been caused by individual acts. The mandate holders requested the Algerian authorities to explain how the decree could be brought into conformity with international human rights obligations arising from the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance.</p><p>On 21 September 2005, the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group addressed a letter to the Government expressing concern regarding Decree No. 05-278. The Chairman-Rapporteur recalled that under the Declaration, disappearance is a continuing crime as long as the fate or whereabouts of the victim are not clarified. He noted that according to the Declaration, perpetrators of acts of enforced disappearances cannot benefit from special amnesty laws and that mitigating circumstances can only be evoked in cases when the perpetrator has contributed to the clarification of the case.</p><p>A reply from the Government dated 28 September 2005 was received in response to the joint communication of the three mandate holders of 27 April 2005. In its reply, the Government recalled that Algeria had undergone a political process of national reconciliation and was seeking a fair and equitable solution to the issue of disappeared persons. Since 1995, the Algerian State had undertaken to address this issue through its national law. General information on the National Consultative Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and the ad hoc mechanism was provided. It was in this context that the President of Algeria had asked for the referendum of 29 September to be held on the draft of a Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation (Decree No. 05-278). The communication indicated that a solution to the problem of disappearance could only be made through a continuous dialogue between concerned parties. Definitive positions or the use of concepts such as impunity was premature.</p><p>A further communication dated the same day was addressed to the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group and to the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. The communication quoted the President's statement that \"persons that have been implicated in crimes will be brought to justice\". It further explained that the Charter was a political document and that legislative texts would be based on it. The Government asserted that it was only the legislative texts that should be analysed to ensure their conformity with international treaties ratified by Algeria.</p><p>On 26 September 2005, a prompt intervention communication (see paragraph 11) was sent to the Government following reports of police violence against families of disappeared persons. The family members reportedly gathered in Constantine every Thursday. It was reported that six mothers of the disappeared, all aged from 60 to 75 years, were arrested and interrogated at the central police station, as were several other demonstrators.</p><p>On 27 October 2005, the Chairman-Rapporteur, on behalf of the Working Group, sent a prompt intervention to the Government concerning the alleged harassment and intimidation of families of victims of disappearances in Relizane at two demonstrations on 18 and 26 October 2005.</p><h1>General allegation</h1><p>Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group under its general allegation procedure (see paragraph 13).</p><p>It was reported that the arrest and disappearance of thousands of men by security forces and State-armed militias during the 1990s, and in particular between 1994 and 1998, left several thousand relatives, the majority of them women, without knowledge of the fate or whereabouts of their husbands, fathers, sons and brothers, and resulted in widespread suffering.</p><p>NGOs stated that families of the victims of enforced disappearance are reportedly denied the right to adequate redress (including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees not to be forcibly disappeared again), the right to family life, and various economic, social and cultural rights.</p><p>Women are reportedly forced to request the issuance of a declaration of absence from judges and officials, who are often the same persons denying or concealing the whereabouts of those womens' husbands or other relatives. According to the reports, some women have refused to initiate the procedure to issue a declaration of absence owing to fear, or because it allows the public prosecutor to declare the disappeared person dead without conducting an investigation.</p><p>NGOs have expressed their concerns about the harassment and intimidation of relatives of disappeared persons by police and the authorities. Peaceful demonstrations or marches in large cities have sometimes been reportedly prevented or violently dispersed by police. Reports state that restrictions have been imposed by the authorities on NGOs working on the issue of disappearances. Owing to a variety of reported administrative and legal obstacles, the five organizations created in the past six years to work on disappearance issues have allegedly not been able to legally register their organizations in Algeria. As a result, they state that their ability to function is seriously hampered.</p><p>Reports from NGOs state that they believe that the Government has failed to take meaningful steps to investigate disappearances. Reportedly, complaints filed in Algerian courts concerning cases of enforced disappearance have either been stalled or closed without results. The authorities reportedly deny that State agents have been responsible for patterns of disappearances. It is reported that the Government asserts that thousands of people have simply \"gone missing\", that individuals are evading arrest for offences committed, have left the country, or were killed during armed confrontations.</p><p>Serious concerns were also expressed by NGOs in relation to the planned referendum on a Charter for Peace and National Reconciliation. They believed that the Charter would lead to impunity for perpetrators of acts of disappearance that were reportedly systematically and widely committed by security forces during that period and that such an amnesty would result in the violation of the right of the families to truth and justice.</p><p>A letter dated 16 November 2004 was received from the Government of Algeria in response to a communication sent by the Working Group under its general allegation procedure. In its reply, the Government provided information on the National Consultative Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. The Government stated that it had addressed the question of disappearance in the framework of legislative and regulatory provisions and through the establishment of specific administrative structures at the level of the Ministry of the Interior to record allegations of disappearance across the nation. The Government reiterated its compassion for the grief of the families, and stated that it wished to draw the Working Group's attention to the calm that must prevail in the consideration of such a sensitive and complex problem, which could not in any event be addressed objectively if it were isolated from the historical background that saw \"the eruption in Algerian society of bloody terrorism and barbarity without precedent anywhere in the world\". Within the Ministry of Justice, a committee mandated to record, centralize and follow up on complaints submitted by families had been established.</p><h1>Request for a visit</h1><p>In April, the Chair of the Working Group met with the Ambassador of Algeria to the United Nations Office at Geneva to discuss the question of a visit by the Working Group to Algeria. In a letter dated 27 June 2005, the Working Group recalled its request to undertake a visit to Algeria. The Working Group had first transmitted a request for an invitation in 2000. No reply has yet been received.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The majority of the cases reported to the Working Group in the past occurred between 1993 and 1997, throughout the country, and concerned workers, peasants, farmers, traders, technicians, students, medical doctors, journalists, university professors, civil servants, and one member of Parliament. Whereas many of the victims were not involved in any particular political activity, a number of the persons concerned were reportedly members or sympathizers of the Islamic Salvation Front (Front islamique du salut). The disappearances were attributed to the army, the security services, the gendarmerie, the police, civil defence forces, or the militia.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has transmitted 1,608 cases to the Government; of those, 9 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government, 7 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, and 1,592 outstanding cases of disappeared persons remain before the Working Group.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group expresses deep concern that little progress has been made in clarifying cases of disappearance in Algeria. Indeed, 253 new cases have been transmitted to the Government of Algeria and others are being processed by the Secretariat.</p><p>The Working Group strongly recommends that the Government of Algeria allow NGOs to undertake their work freely and without impediment, that families of victims of disappearances be left free to organize without bureaucratic restriction or legislative obstacles, and that witnesses be protected.</p><p>The Working Group reminds the Government of Algeria of its obligations under article 14 of the Declaration \"to bring to justice all persons presumed responsible for an act of enforced disappearance\".</p><p>The Working Group reaffirms its request to the Government of Algeria for a country visit aimed at clarifying the 1,592 outstanding cases.</p><h1>Angola</h1><h1>Information from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>In May 2003, three persons were reportedly arrested and disappeared at the hands of soldiers of the Belize 709th Battalion while travelling from the village of Quisoqui to the village of Caio-Guembo.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has transmitted 10 cases to the Government; of those, 7 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 3 outstanding cases of disappeared persons remain before the Working Group.</p><h1>Argentina</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>Two communications were received from the Government of Argentina, one dated 15 March 2005 and the other dated 2 September 2005. Due to translation delays, neither communication has yet been reviewed by the Working Group.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>During the period under review no communication was received from sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Request for a visit</h1><p>During its seventy-fifth session, the Working Group decided to accept the invitation of the Government of Argentina to conduct a mission to Argentina. It was decided that the mission would take place immediately following a session of the Working Group to be held in Buenos Aires in November 2006. On 27 July 2005, the Permanent Mission of Argentina in Geneva confirmed the dates proposed by the Working Group.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The vast majority of the 3,462 previously reported cases of disappearance occurred between 1975 and 1978 under the military Government, in the context of its campaign against left wing guerrillas and their alleged sympathizers. Two cases occurred in 2000 and concerned persons allegedly arrested in the city of Mendoza by members of the local police investigation office (Direccion de Investigaciones de la Policia). The other seven cases concerned persons who were allegedly detained by the police in 2002, following a demonstration.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>Of the 87 cases previously clarified by the Working Group, 44 were clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 43 on the basis of information provided by the source. In respect of the 3,375 outstanding cases, the Working Group is unable to report on the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group would like to thank the Government of Argentina for its invitation to conduct a country visit. The Working Group hopes that in cooperation with the Government and NGOs, progress can be made towards the clarification of the 3,375 cases that have remained unresolved for more than 30 years. The lack of clarifications has concerned the Working Group for many years.</p><h1>Bangladesh</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review, the Government provided two replies on one outstanding case. The Government first reiterated previous information stating that the person had left voluntarily for India. The Government also reported that a three-member commission of inquiry had been established to look into this case. According to the report of the commission submitted to the Ministry of Home Affairs on 27 February 1997, the person had disappeared either voluntarily or involuntarily, but the identity of the culprit could not be ascertained during the inquiry as sufficient evidence had not been found to incriminate any person. The commission recommended that the police continue to investigate the case, in accordance with the law.</p><h1>Information received from the source</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The one case of disappearance reported to the Working Group in the past concerned the organizing secretary of the Hill Women's Federation, an organization for the defence of indigenous people's rights in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. She was allegedly abducted by security personnel prior to the 1996 general elections, an act believed to be linked to her offer of support to a parliamentary candidate representing the interests of indigenous people.</p><p>The Government had previously informed the Working Group that relatives and neighbours had denied that she had been abducted by armed forces personnel. Subsequent investigations had reportedly revealed that she had left the country voluntarily and was residing at an address in India, which was provided. Based on this information, the Working Group decided to apply the six-month rule to the case. However, the relatives subsequently informed the Working Group that the person concerned had not left the country and provided the Working Group with the names of the alleged perpetrators. The Working Group, therefore, decided to consider the case as outstanding (see E/CN.4/2004/58, paragraph 49).</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted one case to the Government, and this one case remains outstanding.</p><h1>Belarus</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review, the Government of Belarus sent two communications to the Working Group on developments concerning the investigations of the three outstanding cases.</p><p>The first communication, dated 18 January 2005, was in respect to all three outstanding cases. The Government stated that forensic DNA tests at the scene of the disappearance were a close match to one victim, but not to the other. The two victims appeared to have been forcibly abducted, but no reliable information as to the involvement of government representatives had been found. A preliminary investigation had been resumed. The information in the document \"Disappeared Persons in Belarus\" of the Rapporteur of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was also cited by the Government. The second communication, dated 11 August 2005, has not yet been translated and therefore has not yet been reviewed by the Working Group.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>On 16 August 2005, the source informed that it continues to monitor these cases but that there have been no new developments.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The three reported cases occurred in 1999.

They were reportedly arrested on 28 March 2005 by men from a paramilitary group called the \"Bloque Centauros\" and subsequently disappeared.</p><p>The 9 September 2005 communication concerned the disappearance of Olver Montoya Caceres, Evert Bonet Quintero, Armelia Quintero and Ciro Navarro, who reportedly disappeared with other peasants on 31 August 2005. These disappearances allegedly took place subsequent to an attack by a large number of \"Bloque Norte\" paramilitary men at \"Playas Ricas\" and \"El Paraiso\". Information received indicated that high-ranking officials of the army and the police, as well as officials of the national Government, denied that these events had occurred.</p><p>On 18 October 2005, an urgent action communication was transmitted concerning the case of the disappearance of the human rights defender Orlando Valencia. Reportedly arrested on 15 October 2005 by the police of Belen de Bajira, he disappeared at the hands of paramilitaries subsequent to his release. The authorities were reportedly immediately informed of his disappearance.</p><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>Two communications from the Government, dated 8 December 2004 and 9 June 2005, were received by the Working Group. The first reported on a compensation decision for one outstanding disappearance case.

Reportedly, successive Governments have and continue to assert that the links between the security forces and paramilitary groups are isolated incidents. However, NGOs allege high-level coordination between paramilitary groups and sectors of the security forces.</p><p>Serious concerns have been expressed by NGOs regarding impunity in relation to the demobilization of members of paramilitary groups and continuing paramilitary activity, including disappearances. NGOs report that a demobilization bill currently pending in the Colombian Congress would allegedly allow paramilitary commanders to serve short jail sentences for serious crimes.</p><p>Reportedly, the military justice system continues to claim jurisdiction over cases of alleged human rights violations committed by the security forces, despite the 1997 ruling of the Constitutional Court that such cases must be investigated by the civilian justice system. According to reports, in January 2004, the criminal investigation into accusations against General Alvaro Velandia Hurtado for the disappearance and killing of Nydia Erika Bautista in 1987 was terminated, despite the reported request by the Procurator-General to the Attorney-General to pursue the investigation.</p><h1>Request for a visit</h1><p>The Working Group undertook a mission to Colombia from 5 to 13 July 2005.

In a large number of these cases, those responsible were allegedly members of paramilitary groups whose actions were believed to have been undertaken with the complicity or acquiescence of members of the security forces. Those abducted included members of trade unions, peasants and community workers.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 1,165 cases to the Government; of those, 67 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, 201 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 897 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group urges the Government of Colombia to take effective measures to implement the recommendations contained in the report of the Working Group issued after its country visit of 5-13 July 2005.

Further, they noted three points: first, that the Government had already responded to the United Nations on 34 cases; second, that of the 80 cases, information on the disappeared persons was incomplete and would make finding them difficult; and third, the same allegations were currently under consideration in a domestic court case.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>During the period under review, additional information was received from the source, which has not yet been processed owing to time constraints.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>Most of the previous 34 reported cases of disappearance occurred between May and August 1999, and concerned persons who were separated from a convoy returning to Brazzaville from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and taken for interrogation by members of the security forces.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 114 cases to the Government, and they remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group wishes to remind the Government of the Republic of the Congo of its responsibility to conduct thorough and impartial investigations \"for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified\", in accordance with article 13, paragraph 6, of the Declaration.</p><p>Further, the Working Group invites the Government of the Republic of Congo to cooperate to clarify the 114 outstanding cases.</p><h1>Democratic People's Republic of Korea</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>The Government transmitted a communication dated 7 March 2005 to the Working Group which stated that it had already fully informed the Working Group of the authorities' position regarding the issue of the outstanding disappearance cases attributed to their country.</p><p>According to the communication, \"the issue of `missing' Japanese is a product of the unprecedented Japanese hostile policy toward the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] and the relations of intense hostility between the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] and Japan, which have persisted for more than a century\".</p><p>The authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea state that in November 2004, they had received a delegation from Japan and handed over the remains and articles of the deceased persons who had been abducted by government forces.</p><p>The communication, and a similar one dated 15 August 2005, stated that a disappearance reported to have occurred at the border of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had been fabricated and that there had been no incident there \"before, during and after\" the alleged date of this reported disappearance.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>In a communication dated 12 August 2005, the source reaffirms the information that it had forwarded to the Working Group on the case of the disappearance near the border between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p><p>In a communication dated 26 January 2005, the Permanent Mission of Japan in Geneva reported on meetings with the authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea concerning the issue of disappeared Japanese nationals. The communication stated that at the meetings, held between 9 and 14 November 2004, the authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had handed over human remains. The Government of Japan reported that DNA testing had showed that the remains were not those of the disappeared Japanese nationals.</p><p>A communication from the Government of Japan dated 14 March 2005 stated that there had been no new information leading to the confirmation of the whereabouts of the nine abducted Japanese nationals.</p><p>In a communication dated 29 July 2005, the Permanent Mission of Japan in Geneva reported that subsequent to the 30 May 2005 meeting with the Working Group, the Japanese authorities had made every possible effort to resolve the disappearance issue, harnessing a wide range of diplomatic opportunities including direct dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, consultation with other countries and at the United Nations, such as the meetings of the Working Group. However, there had been no new additional information leading to the confirmation of the whereabouts of the nine abductees. The Japanese authorities asked the Working Group to strongly urge the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to make a sincere effort to confirm the whereabouts of the nine disappeared persons.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>In addition to the eight disappeared Japanese nationals abducted from 1977 to 1980, a more recent case was reported of the disappearance of a national of the Republic of Korea on the border between China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the period under review, the Working Group has transmitted nine cases to the Government; none has been clarified.

He was reportedly arrested on Monday, 21 February 2005 by military servicemen based in the village of Kahangam and detained for four days in a prison. Then he was allegedly transferred to the headquarters of the 11th brigade in Katale, territory of Masisi, Province of North-Kivu, on 3 March 2005 under the command of Colonel Bonane.

A significant number of cases concerned Shia Muslims who are reported to have disappeared in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the course of the expulsion of their families to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Other cases occurred in the aftermath of the March 1991 uprising by Arab Shia Muslims in the south and by Kurds in the north. Earlier cases took place in 1983, when Iraqi forces allegedly arrested a large number of Kurds from the Barzani clan, near Arbil. Some 30 cases which reportedly occurred in 1996 concerned members of the Yazidi community who were allegedly arrested during a wave of mass arrests in Mosul by members of the security forces. Other cases involved Shia Muslims who were reportedly detained in Karbala in 1996, as they were about to begin a pilgrimage.

Reports urge the Government of Lebanon to cooperate with the Syrian authorities as well as with the international community with a view to resolving the issue of disappearances.</p><p>In response to the general allegation, the Government of Lebanon provided information about the recent developments regarding the question of Lebanese detainees and disappeared persons in Syria. In particular, information was received concerning the newly established Joint Lebanon-Syria Committee which is mandated to examine this issue. They stated that at the conclusion of the work of the Joint Committee, a final report would be submitted to the Lebanese Council of Ministers.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The majority of the 319 cases reported in the past occurred between 1982 and 1985 in the context of the Lebanese civil war.

Referring to the presentation made by a representative of the Royal Malaysian Police to the Working Group in 2004, the Government requested the Working Group to provide additional and new information on this case.</p><p>Over the years, the Working Group has made numerous attempts to contact the source, but to no avail. Consequently, the Working Group decided, in accordance with paragraph 21 of its methods of work, to discontinue consideration of the one case. The Working Group believes that it no longer has a useful role to play in trying to elucidate the whereabouts of the person concerned, as no follow-up can be given to the case.</p><h1>Information from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The one outstanding case of disappearance reportedly occurred in 1998 and concerned an Achenese activist of Indonesian nationality with permanent resident status in Malaysia.

Of those cases 98 took place in the context of rural guerrilla warfare in the State of Guerrero. Between 1994 and 1997, 89 cases occurred and 22 in 1995, primarily in the States of Chiapas and Veracruz. Most of those concerned were members of Indian, peasant and political organizations.

Given time limitations, only 42 cases were reviewed by the Working Group in 2004. During the period under review, the Working Group finished the consideration of the information submitted by the Moroccan authorities. In 56 cases, the Working Group decided that the information provided was not sufficient to consider the cases clarified and decided to retransmit these cases to the authorities. In reviewing the remaining eight cases, the Working Group asked the Government of Morocco for more information. At the seventy-seventh session, during a meeting of the Working Group with representatives of the Government, detailed information was received on cases which will be reviewed in 2006 and the Government informed the Working Group about developments in the protection of human rights in Morocco.</p><h1>Information received from the source</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Clarifications</h1><p>Based on information from the Government, the Working Group decided this year to clarify 3 cases (see paragraph 9).</p><h1>Request for a visit</h1><p>On 8 November 2005 a letter was sent to the Moroccan authorities requesting a visit.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The majority of the 248 cases the Working Group has transmitted to the Government occurred between 1972 and 1980. Most of them concerned persons of Saharan origin who reportedly disappeared in territories under the control of the Moroccan forces because they or their relatives were known or suspected supporters of the Polisario Front. Students and well-educated Saharans were allegedly particular targets. The disappeared persons were reportedly confined in secret detention centres, such as Laayoune, Qal'at M'gouna, Agdz and Tazmamart.

In accordance with its methods of work, the Working Group sent a copy of the case to the Government of Thailand. In 2004, the Government reported that the person had neither entered nor disappeared on Myanmar territory. They stated that the National Human Rights Commission was unable to proceed with the investigation owing to insufficient information on the matter. The Government asked that more information be provided to enable it to conduct further investigations.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted three cases to the Government; of those, two cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and one case remains outstanding.</p><h1>Namibia</h1><h1>Information from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The one case reported to the Working Group occurred in 1999 and concerned a member of the Namibian National Society for Human Rights, who was allegedly detained following the imposition of a state of emergency in the Caprivi region and taken to an unknown destination.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group transmitted one case to the Government. This case remains outstanding before the Working Group.</p><h1>Nepal</h1><h1>Urgent actions</h1><p>During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted 30 cases to the Government under the urgent action procedure. In several cases, the persons had been rearrested by the security forces immediately after their release on court orders issued subsequent to habeas corpus petitions. One example of this practice of particular concern to the Working Group because of the ages of the victims was the case of two 15-year-old Dalit girls who were rearrested by the police after their release on order of the Appellate Court.</p><h1>Standard cases</h1><p>The newly transmitted cases concern a woman, a journalist, an agricultural worker, a vendor and a Kashmiri residing in Kathmandu. In the case of the Kashmiri, it was reported that the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu was involved in the arrest. In accordance with the Working Group's methods of work, a copy of this case was sent to the Government of India. (See also section on India, paragraph 264.</p><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review, the Government replied on 143 outstanding cases. Multiple replies were frequently received during the year on the same cases, sometimes from different government agencies. In the majority of cases, the Government reported that persons had been released or were in detention. The Working Group decided to apply the six-month rule to 69 cases.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>During the period under review, sources provided additional information on 61 outstanding cases. In 25 cases, sources provided the Working Group with information sufficient to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the persons. In the majority of cases, the persons had been detained or released. In the case of a 15-year-old girl, it was reported that she was tortured in the military barracks in Kavre District before being put to death in February 2004.</p><h1>Clarifications</h1><p>Based on information received from the Government, the Working Group decided to clarify 50 cases (see paragraph 9).</p><p>Based on information received from sources, the Working Group decided to clarify 25 cases.</p><h1>Prompt intervention</h1><p>On 14 January 2005, a prompt intervention (see paragraph 11) letter was sent to the Government of Nepal on alleged increasing harassment, intimidation and direct threats from the security forces towards human rights defenders, including journalists, lawyers, local human rights activists working on disappearances and staff of the National Human Rights Commission. It was reported that security forces personnel had targeted human rights defenders and threatened the relatives of detainees and their lawyers who had filed habeas corpus petitions in the courts.</p><h1>General allegation</h1><p>The Working Group received information from NGOs concerning reported non-compliance by the Government of Nepal with provisions of the Declaration (see paragraph 13).</p><p>Reports expressed concern about a widespread pattern of enforced or involuntary disappearances, said to be one of the most pressing human rights issues in Nepal. Reports stated that disappearances, already a chronic problem in Nepal, had continued under the state of emergency announced on 1 February 2005 and there had been increased pressure on human rights activists assisting relatives of the disappeared. In a number of cases, the missing persons were believed to be held in incommunicado detention, primarily in army barracks and camps across Nepal, while some were believed to have been killed after being taken into custody by the security forces.</p><p>Reports stated that the security forces are responsible not only for disappearances but also extrajudicial executions, torture and arbitrary detentions. The human rights situation was reportedly deteriorating in the context of counter-insurgency operations by the security forces in their response to the \"people's war\" being fought by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) since 1996. Further, since the King's declaration of a state of emergency on 1 February 2005, fundamental rights had allegedly been suspended and the security forces are reported to enjoy widespread impunity. Reportedly, the security forces arrest and detain suspects illegally and undermine judicial processes, especially those relating to habeas corpus.</p><p>Reports have identified impunity for human rights abuses as a key factor fuelling the human rights crisis. The Government and the Royal Nepalese Army reportedly have failed to take action to prevent and punish human rights abuses committed by the security forces. No senior official reportedly has ever been held accountable for a disappearance in Nepal. Further, according to the reports, staff of the National Human Rights Commission have been prevented from accessing these places of detention, in violation of their mandated powers under the Human Rights Commission Act, and the Commission's findings and recommendations are widely ignored by the Government.</p><p>Reports add that even though the Government has not directly ordered the security forces to commit disappearances as part of its measures against the Maoists insurgency, the Government should be held responsible for disappearances given its failure to take reasonable steps to prevent and punish the crime of disappearance. Reports call on the Nepalese authorities to take immediate measures to put an end to the practice of disappearances, investigate all reported cases, and publicly instruct the security forces that abuses are not permitted.</p><h1>Press release</h1><p>During the period under review, the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group issued a joint statement, dated 8 February 2005, with eight other United Nations independent experts, expressing serious concern about the actions taken by the King to dissolve the constitutional Government and to assume direct power; proclaim a nationwide state of emergency and suspend constitutional guarantees and civil and political liberties.</p><p>In addition, on the occasion of the International Day of the Disappeared, the Working Group issued a statement on 26 August 2004 in which it emphasized its particular concern over the harassment of families of disappeared persons or human rights defenders in Nepal. The Working Group also urged the Nepalese authorities to fully implement the recommendations issued following its country visit of December 2004.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The majority of the cases reported to the Working Group allegedly occurred between 1998 and 2005 in the context of counter-insurgency operations launched by security forces against members and supporters of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), which had declared a \"people's war\" in February 1996. During the first phase of this conflict, disappearances occurred during police operations (1998). As security operations intensified, the number of cases reported increased during 1999 and 2001, particularly after November 2001, following the declaration of a state of emergency and the deployment of the army. Following the breakdown of a seven-month ceasefire on 27 August 2003, there was a rapid escalation in the number of disappearances. Most cases concerned persons who were arrested by unidentified security forces personnel in plain clothes from their homes, often at night or in the early morning. Although disappearances reportedly were taking place across the country, the majority of cases reported to the Working Group occurred in and around Kathmandu and other districts in central Nepal. The reported victims included women, students, businessmen, farmers, workers, a writer, a government employee and human rights defenders. The disappearances were attributed to security forces personnel, the armed forces and the police.</p><p>Regarding cases of three members of the Akhil Bharatiya Nepali Ekta Samaj (All India Nepalese Unit Society) who were reportedly arrested by the Indian Special Branch Police and handed over to Nepali security officials at the border, in Nepalgunj. In accordance with the Working Group's methods of work, copies of these cases were sent to the Government of India. (See also section on India, paragraph 269.</p><p>At the invitation of the Government of Nepal, the Working Group visited the country from 6 to 14 December 2004 to discuss the cases of enforced or involuntary disappearance transmitted by the Working Group to the Government and to examine the situation of disappearances in Nepal in the light of international human rights standards. The delegation held meetings with His Majesty the King and other high-level officials from the Government, judiciary and military, as well as with representatives of NGOs, relatives of the disappeared, and members of the international community in Nepal. The Working Group found that the phenomenon of disappearance in Nepal was widespread; its use by the Nepalese security forces was arbitrary. Maoist insurgents also commit widespread illegal deprivations of liberty.</p><p>The main recommendation to the Government was that Nepalese criminal law and the Army Act should be amended and the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) Ordinance rescinded immediately. It was also recommended that complete lists of detainees be kept, and shared with families of the detainees and with civilian authorities. The Working Group recommended that the authorities ensure that human rights defenders be protected from persecution for their work and continue to make every effort to strengthen the role of the National Human Rights Commission and to facilitate its work. In addition, the Working Group recommended that the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations evaluate the future participation of Nepalese security forces in United Nations peacekeeping missions, assessing the suitability of such participation against progress made in the reduction of disappearances and other human rights violations attributed to the Nepalese security forces, and seek the cooperation of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to review progress. (See the mission report, E/CN.4/2005/65/Add.1. ) Reportedly, there has been little implementation of these recommendations so far, especially given that the absence of a functioning Parliament is a major obstacle to the implementation of recommendations concerning legislative reforms.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 338 cases to the Government; of those, 59 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, 54 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 225 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group encourages the Government of Nepal to implement the recommendations of the Working Group following its country visit in 2004. The Working Group also invites the Government to meet with the Working Group in 2006 to discuss the implementation of those recommendations.</p><p>Nepal was the source of the largest number of urgent-action cases transmitted by the Working Group in 2005. The Working Group remains deeply concerned about the number of new cases of disappearance in Nepal.</p><p>The Working Group urges the Government of Nepal to take all necessary action to prevent further disappearances, the practice of rearrest, and the harassment of human rights defenders and the relatives of the disappeared. The Working Group urges the Government to continue cooperation on the clarification of outstanding cases and to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p><h1>Nicaragua</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The majority of the cases reported to the Working Group occurred between 1979 and 1983, in the context of the internal armed conflict which took place during the 1980s. Many of the reports of these disappearances pointed to the involvement of members of the army, the former Sandinista Government, the former General Directorate for the Security of the State and the Frontier Guard. Two cases, however, reportedly occurred in 1994: one concerned a farmer who was allegedly detained by a group of members of the army and the police, and the other concerned a person allegedly accused of being a member of the Contras armed group.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 234 cases to the Government; of those, 19 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, 112 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 103 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group continues to be concerned that little has been done to clarify the 103 outstanding cases. The Working Group wishes to remind the Government of its responsibilities under article 13 of the Declaration to conduct investigations thoroughly and impartially for as long as the fate of the victim remains unclarified.</p><h1>Nigeria</h1><h1>Information from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The one outstanding case is reported to have occurred in 1998 and concerned a human rights activist who was allegedly arrested at Murtala airport in Lagos by security forces.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past the Working Group has transmitted six cases to the Government. The Working Group has clarified five cases on the basis of information provided by the Government. There remains one outstanding case before the Working Group.</p><h1>Pakistan</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review, the Government replied on 30 outstanding cases.</p><p>The Government provided the Working Group with the current addresses of eight persons reported disappeared. The Working Group decided to apply the six-month rule in these eight cases. The Working Group decided to allow the source to respond within nine months instead of six months as a special exception, given the situation in the country following the earthquake.</p><h1>Information received from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The majority of the 83 cases of reported disappearance concerned members or sympathizers of the political party Muhajir Qaomi Movement, who were allegedly arrested by the police or security forces in 1995 and 2001. Most of the other reported cases allegedly occurred in 1986, and between 1989 and 1991, and involved Afghan refugees in Pakistan, many with links to the Harakate Inghilabe Islami party of Afghanistan. The disappearances were reportedly perpetrated in Peshawar, North West Frontier Province, by persons belonging to a rival party, the Hezb-e-Islami of Afghanistan, allegedly acting with the acquiescence of the Pakistani authorities. Four other cases concerned members of the same family who were reportedly abducted by agents of military intelligence in Islamabad in 1996.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 83 cases to the Government; of those, 4 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, 4 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 75 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Palestine</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>No communication has ever been received by the Working Group from the Palestinian Authority regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information received from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>Of the three reported cases of disappearance, two reportedly occurred in 1997. One concerned a person who was allegedly taken away from his sister's home in Deir-al-Balah by persons who had identified themselves as military intelligence officers; the other concerned a real estate agent, the father of five children, who allegedly disappeared after his arrest by members of the Palestinian military intelligence in Ramallah. A case which reportedly occurred in 2001 concerned a United States citizen of Palestinian descent who allegedly disappeared near the Israeli settlement of Ofrah: eyewitness accounts and a blue tape found on his car, abandoned near the settlement, reportedly indicated that it had been searched for explosives by the Israeli Defence Forces. In accordance with the methods of work of the Working Group, a copy of the case was also sent to the Government of Israel and to the Government of the United States of America.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted three cases to the Palestinian Authority; all of them remain outstanding.</p><h1>Paraguay</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review, on 2 August 2005, the Government of Paraguay transmitted detailed information on the judicial process in the three outstanding cases.</p><p>According to this information, on 9 May 1991, the Seventh Rota Criminal Court of the Asuncion Judicial District opened a pretrial investigation into the alleged disappearances.</p><p>According to the Paraguayan authorities, the criminal proceedings were unsuccessful owing to a lack of evidence to determine the perpetrators' identity, despite numerous and repeated inquiries ordered by the competent court. The investigation was reportedly also considerably hampered because the victims' family members were absent from the proceedings and by the difficulty of finding witnesses who might be able to testify on the circumstances of the disappearance.</p><p>The authorities added that in 2001, the wife of one of the subjects initiated criminal proceedings in respect of the three cases against Alfredo Stroessner and others for criminal violation of human life, abuse of authority, unlawful deprivation of liberty, abduction, torture and other offences. The case came before Guarantee Court No. 1 of the capital under the new system of criminal procedure. Reportedly, criminal investigations are currently being carried out, under court supervision and with judicial safeguards, by the competent prosecutor responsible for the public right of action and criminal prosecutions.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The 23 cases of disappearance reported to the Working Group occurred between 1975 and 1977 under the Government of President Alfredo Stroessner. Several of the disappeared persons were members of the Communist Party, including its Secretary-General. Although disappearances took place in the capital, Asuncion, the majority of the cases affected the rural population and were carried out in the districts of San Jose, Santa Helena, Piribebuy and Santa Rosa.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 23 cases to the Government; of those, 20 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 3 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Peru</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information received from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The vast majority of the 3,006 reported cases of disappearance occurred between 1983 and 1992 in the context of the Government's fight against, in particular, the Communist Party of Peru, Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso), and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. In late 1982, the armed forces and police undertook a counter-insurgency campaign and the armed forces were granted a great deal of latitude in fighting Sendero Luminoso and restoring public order. The majority of reported disappearances took place in areas of the country that had been under a state of emergency and were under military control, in particular in the Departments of Apurimac, Ayacucho, Huancavelica, San Martin and Ucayali. Detentions were frequently carried out openly by uniformed members of the army and the navy infantry, sometimes together with civil defence groups.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted a total of 3,006 cases to the Government; of those, 385 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, 253 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 2,368 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group wishes to remind the Government of Peru once again of its responsibility to conduct thorough and impartial investigations \"for as long as the fate of the victim of enforced disappearance remains unclarified\", in accordance with article 13, paragraph 6, of the Declaration.</p><p>The Working Group invites the Government of Peru to meet with the Working Group in 2006 to discuss means of encouraging the clarification of cases.</p><h1>Philippines</h1><h1>Urgent actions</h1><p>Urgent action cases transmitted to the Government during the period under review include the cases of four farmers reportedly arrested together in Andap Valley, Buhisan, San Agustin, Surigao del Sur, by the 58th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine army.</p><p>The other urgent action cases concern seven persons who were arrested by elements of Alpha Company of the 12th Infantry Battalion at a checkpoint on the highway at Barangay Camingawan, Kabankalan City. Reportedly, the military immediately separated the Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP) consultant from the other six persons and took him away in an unknown direction. The other six persons, including three members of KMP, a member of the National Federation of Sugar Workers, a farmer and a driver, allegedly disappeared after they were taken from Haba Military detachment in Candoni to the Municipal Hall of Candoni.</p><h1>Standard cases</h1><p>The 28 cases transmitted by the Working Group to the Government during the period under review occurred throughout the country between 1981 and 2000. The arrests were reportedly carried out by the police, the army and other military organizations or police units. Alleged victims include three women; two of them were reportedly abducted together by the Integrated National Police elements in Naga City, Camarines Sur. In another case, of a 19-year-old girl, the relatives reportedly spoke with her several times at the camp headquarters of the 187th PC in Aurora where she was initially detained. However, when the relatives visited again, they were told that she had escaped from the camp and since then, no one has seen her.</p><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review, the Government replied on 10 outstanding cases. In three cases, the Working Group found the information from the Government insufficient to clarify the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared persons. In seven cases, the Government replied that there was no indication of the State's involvement with the disappearance. In one case concerning a member of the New People's Army (NPA), according to the source in its initial communication, who has allegedly been killed in an encounter with the military, the Working Group decided that it had made a mistake in originally accepting the case. The case was not a disappearance.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>During the period under review, sources provided additional information on five cases. Regarding four cases whose admissibility the Government questioned, the source provided further information supporting the allegation that the arrests had been carried out by agents of the State.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The majority of the reported cases of disappearance occurred throughout the country in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the context of the Government's anti-insurgency campaign. Alleged victims included farmers, students, social and health workers, members of Church groups, lawyers, journalists and economists. Since 1980, reported cases of disappearance concerned young men living in rural and urban areas who participated in legally constituted organizations which, according to the military authorities, were fronts for the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the NPA. Among the groups most commonly targeted were members of KADENA (Youth for Democracy and Nationalism) and the National Federation of Sugar Workers. Despite the peace talks initiated by the Government with several opposition movements, disappearances continued to occur in the 1990s, mainly in the context of military operations against the NPA, the Moro National Liberation Front, the Mindanao Islamic Liberation Front, the Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Units and the Civilian Volunteer Organizations. In 2004, the Working Group transmitted 25 cases of disappearance to the Government of the Philippines, 4 of which occurred in 2004 and the other 21 between 1977 and 1993. Alleged victims included farmers, a staff member of the Suriago-Agusan Workers Solidarity, a community organizer in northern Luzon, a member of the People's Youth Organization known as the \"Samaang Demokratikong Kataan (SDK)\", and an 11-year-old girl from a peasant family and suspected members of the NPA. The disappearances were attributed to the police, the military forces and other military organizations or police units such as the Infantry Battalions of Philippines Army, the Philippine Constabulary, the Central Intelligence Unit, the Intelligence Service Unit, airborne troops, the Integrated Civilian Home Defence Force, army scout rangers, the Presidential Anti-Organized-Crime Task Force, Police Volunteers for Anti-Crime, the \"General Headquarters\", and the Criminal Service Group.</p><p>The Working Group visited the Philippines in 1991. As noted by the Working Group in previous reports, the main recommendation to the Government was that the national police should be severed from the army and put under a different Cabinet minister. The Working Group suggested that the Government should introduce legislation to narrow the powers of arrest by strictly defining which category of public official could arrest civilians for which offence. It was also recommended that the Philippines Commission on Human Rights be empowered to make unannounced spot-checks at places of detention. Protection of witnesses and an overhaul of the law and habeas corpus practice were recommended in order to expedite the procedure and make it more effective (see E/CN.4/1991/20/Add.1, paragraph 168).</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 752 cases to the Government; of those, 33 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, 124 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 595 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group again encourages the Government to report on the implementation of the recommendations emanating from the Working Group's visit of 1991. The Working Group is concerned about disappearances which allegedly occurred in 2004. It reminds the Government of its obligation under article 13 of the Declaration to make every effort to clarify the 594 outstanding cases. The Working Group invites the Government of the Philippines to meet with the Working Group in 2006.</p><p>The Working Group welcomes the consolidation of the anti-disappearance bills, which have been under consideration for several years, and the subsequent approval of the consolidated bill by the Committee on Justice of the House of Representatives on 16 November 2005. The Working Group encourages the timely adoption of this important legislation.</p><h1>Russian Federation</h1><h1>Urgent actions</h1><p>During the period under review, urgent action communications were sent on a number of cases. The majority of cases occurred in Chechnya.</p><p>These cases occurred between September 2004 and April 2005 in various locations such as Argun, Grozny and Koren-Benoj.</p><p>Other urgent action communications were sent concerning relatives of Aslan Maskhadov, the former President of the Republic of Chechnya. They reportedly disappeared in December 2004 in various locations of Chechnya at the hands of forces under the control of a Chechen Government leader.</p><p>An urgent action communication was also sent by the Working Group concerning three persons, including a 15-year-old child, who reportedly disappeared following a sweep operation carried out by military servicemen that took place from 14 to 16 January 2005 in the village of Zumsoj.</p><p>Urgent action communications were sent to the Russian authorities concerning cases of disappearances allegedly carried out by military servicemen on 11 January 2005 in Argun; by a group of armed men on 27 December 2004 in Sernodovsk; by the Federal Security Service on 20 April 2005 in Khasavyurt of the Republic of Daghestan; and of a teacher in a religious school in Kazan, Tatarstan.</p><p>In joint urgent action communications with other thematic special procedures mandate holders, the following cases were transmitted to the Government of the Russian Federation: a person who disappeared following abduction by a group of at least 15 armed men in Grozny on 20 January 2005; and the head of the NGO Let's Save the Generation reportedly disappeared after his arrest by law enforcement agents believed to be from the Federal Security Service on 15 April 2005.</p><h1>Standard cases</h1><p>During the period under review, 11 cases were transmitted under the standard procedure to the Government of the Russian Federation. These cases reportedly took place on the territory of Chechnya. In one case, a woman disappeared after reportedly being abducted from her home in Urus-Martan with her husband. Her husband was released shortly afterwards, on 25 February 2004. Another case concerns a man who reportedly disappeared at the hands of forces under the orders of a Chechen Government leader on 1 June 2004 in Starye Atagi. A further case concerns a man who disappeared after reportedly being abducted on a street in Shali on 13 June 2004. In another case, a man disappeared after being arrested by a group of 10 men from his home in Grozny on 22 October 2004.</p><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>In one communication, the Russian Federation authorities provided information on one case, stating that the investigator of the Leninsky district procurator's office in Grozny decided, on the basis of article 24 (1), paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation not to open a criminal case for lack of evidence of a crime. On 21 February 2005 the Procurator's Office of the Republic of Chechnya overruled the decision not to initiate a criminal case.</p><p>In a further communication, the Russian Federation authorities stated that the Argun city procurator's office initiated a criminal case on the basis of indications of an offence under article 126 (abduction) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.</p><p>In a communication, the Russian Federation authorities provided information on 4 cases that occurred in the settlement of Zumsoj. According to the information, a special operation had been conducted from 14 to 17 January 2005 in the area of Zumsoj and steps were being taken to check the accuracy of the facts, as well as the involvement of military personnel in the detention of four villagers and their whereabouts.</p><p>In two communications, the Russian Federation authorities provided information on the cases of the members of the family of Aslan Maskhadov, indicating that investigations had been opened on these reported disappearances.</p><p>In a further communication, the Russian Federation authorities provided information on one case, stating that a special operation had been conducted in Grozny and that six Chechen fighters were killed as a result of the confrontation; among those found carrying weapons was a person whose name had been communicated by the Working Group to the Government. This information was subsequently transmitted to the source.</p><p>In another communication, the Russian Federation authorities provided information on a case, reporting that the subject had attempted to escape custody by jumping out of a second-storey window and was injured. He was charged and on 16 February 2005, the criminal case was referred to the court for consideration on the merits.</p><p>Seven other communications were received by the authorities that had not yet been translated for review by the Working Group.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>Additional information was provided by the source on the seven disappeared relatives of the former Chechen leader Aslan Makhadov and transmitted to the Government. In a second communication, the source reported that the seven persons had been released on 31 May 2005. They reportedly had been held together in an unfurnished cement cell, and on 30 May 2005, a person in civilian clothes came to them and announced their release. According to its methods of work, the Working Group decided to clarify these cases.</p><h1>Clarifications</h1><p>During the period under review, eight cases were clarified by the source (see paragraph 10).</p><h1>Prompt intervention</h1><p>A prompt intervention letter (see paragraph 11) was sent on 16 February 2005 on the case of the spouse of a disappeared person who had reportedly been followed by military servicemen.</p><p>A prompt intervention communication was sent to the authorities of the Russian Federation concerning incidents that occurred on 18 February 2005 at the Memorial Research Centre of Saint Petersburg. Reportedly, the Centre was attacked by three men who beat an employee, who was found the day after in critical condition. According to the source, some of the office equipment was destroyed and documents were stolen. This attack was reportedly preceded by other attacks, threats and ill-treatment of the members of the organization.</p><p>The Russian Federation authorities provided information on the events related to the attack on the Memorial Research Centre in Saint Petersburg, and stated that a criminal investigation had been opened.</p><h1>General allegation</h1><p>Information was submitted by NGOs to the Working Group concerning alleged non-compliance by the Government of the Russian Federation with provisions of the Declaration (see paragraph 13).</p><p>According to the reports, enforced disappearances in Chechnya are both widespread and systematic. According to government statistics quoted by NGOs, at least 2,090 people have disappeared since the conflict started in 1999. NGOs estimate the figure to be between 3,000 and 5,000. According to those organizations, statements by officials reportedly provide irrefutable evidence that the authorities - both local and federal - are fully aware of the problem of disappearances in Chechnya and its actual scale.</p><p>According to the reports of NGOs, disappearances are not random acts of criminality but rather follow a systematic pattern. They state that while the Russian Government frequently claims that Chechen rebel forces are responsible for disappearances, evidence reportedly shows that federal or pro-Moscow Chechen law enforcement, military or security agents and forces are responsible for most of these acts. According to the reports, while in previous years Russian forces were the main perpetrators of disappearances, over the last year they reportedly seem to have been replaced by Chechen security forces.</p><p>Reportedly, no one has been held accountable for any act of enforced disappearance since the conflict began in 1999. NGOs assert that the Government has not established a meaningful accountability process for reported abuses by Russian and pro-Moscow Chechen forces. The alleged lack of progress made in investigations is reportedly a reflection of the authorities' perceived resistance to bringing perpetrators to justice. According to a list of servicemen convicted of crimes against civilians compiled by the Office of the Prosecutor General in 2004, NGOs report that there were no convictions in relation to cases of persons reported to be victims of disappearance. NGOs document what they state is a pattern for criminal cases opened to investigate reports of disappearances: they are closed or suspended after several months, reportedly justified on the grounds of the \"impossibility of establishing the identity of the perpetrators\".</p><h1>Request for a visit</h1><p>Following a decision of the Working Group, a request for a visit was sent on 11 April 2005 to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. The Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group later met with the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations Office at Geneva to discuss the request.</p><p>In a communication from the Permanent Mission dated 6 October 2005, the Working Group was informed that the \"Russian Federation is willing to continue the constructive cooperation with the Working Group and in this regard, is ready to consider positively its request to undertake a visit to Russia\".</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>A large number of the cases transmitted in the past concerned persons of ethnic Ingush origin who allegedly disappeared in 1992, in the context of the fighting between ethnic Ossetians and Ingush. The majority of the remaining cases were reported to have occurred in the Republic of Chechnya, primarily since 1994, in the context of the conflict between the Government and rebel forces. The disappearances were alleged to have been carried out by Russian armed and security forces.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 461 cases to the Government; of those, 9 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, 1 case has been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 451 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group is gravely concerned about the new cases that continue to occur in the Russian Federation and the large number of unresolved cases arising from the conflicts in the northern Caucasus. The Working Group reiterates to the Government its obligation under the Declaration to prevent and to terminate all acts of enforced disappearance and to prosecute alleged perpetrators.</p><p>The Working Group welcomes the invitation by the Government of the Russian Federation to the Working Group to conduct a country visit, and looks forward to setting dates as soon as possible.</p><h1>Rwanda</h1><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>On 25 August 2005 Rwandan officials submitted a progress report covering the period since June 2004 on the investigation carried out on one outstanding case.</p><h1>Information received from sources</h1><p>On 8 March 2005, additional information was received on the case of a disappeared law professor. This information was subsequently transmitted to the Government of Rwanda.</p><h1>Prompt intervention</h1><p>On 6 October 2005, information concerning the harassment and intimidation of the family and friends of a disappeared person whose case was still outstanding was received. Subsequently, a prompt intervention (see paragraph 11) letter was sent on 26 October 2005 from the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group to the Government of Rwanda concerning these allegations.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>Most of the 21 outstanding cases transmitted in the past occurred between 1990 and 1996. Of these, five cases occurred in 1990 and 1991 in the north of the country in the context of the ethnic conflict between Tutsis and Hutus. Those reported to have disappeared included students who were suspected of supporting the Rwandese Popular Front, the mayor of Nyabikenke, a journalist, a mechanic and a factory manager. One case concerned a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who was allegedly arrested at the border between Rwanda and Uganda. The disappearances were attributed to the armed forces, the Gendarmerie nationale and the Rwandese Patriotic Army. Other cases involved 18 Rwandan refugees and a professor who reportedly disappeared in what was then Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In accordance with the methods of work of the Working Group, copies of these cases were sent to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see paragraph 194).</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 24 cases to the Government; of those, 2 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the sources and 22 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Saudi Arabia</h1><h1>Standard cases</h1><p>During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted the case of Mazhar Hasan to the Government. It was reported that the person was arrested in 1995 by the Saudi Arabian police in Jadalah and was last seen in 1999 in Jeddah prison.</p><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review, the Government replied on two outstanding cases, requesting the Working Group to provide it with further information. This request was conveyed to the source by the Working Group. Over the years, the Working Group has made numerous attempts to contact the source of the two cases, but to no avail. Consequently, the Working Group decided, in accordance with paragraph 21 of its methods of work, to discontinue consideration of the two cases. The Working Group believes that it no longer has a useful role to play in trying to elucidate the whereabouts of the persons concerned, as no follow-up can be given to the case.</p><h1>Information from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The three previously reported cases of disappearance concerned a businessman who was reportedly arrested by Jordanian security forces in Amman in 1991 and later handed over to Saudi Arabian authorities; a lecturer at King Saud University whose house was allegedly searched by security service officers after his disappearance, his bank account frozen and his wife and children prevented from leaving the country; and a contractor, a citizen of Pakistan, who was allegedly abducted by a government secret service agency in Jeddah in 1997.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted four cases to the Government; of those, one case has been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and the Working Group decided to discontinue consideration of two cases. Accordingly, one case remains outstanding.</p><h1>Serbia and Montenegro</h1><h1>Standard cases</h1><p>During the period under review, the Working Group transmitted the case of Malik Meholjic to the Government of Serbia and Montenegro. It was reported that he was arrested by officers of the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Montenegro from the police headquarters of Bar, and was last seen entering a police car and being driven away to an unknown location.</p><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information received from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The 16 previously reported cases of disappearance occurred in 1999 and 2000.

In 3 cases, the persons had been released and in 1,190 cases, the persons were reportedly dead.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The cases reported to the Working Group are alleged to have occurred in the context of two major conflicts in Sri Lanka: the confrontation between Tamil militants and government forces in the north and north-east of the country and that between the People's Liberation Front (JVP) and government forces in the south. Between 1987 and 1990, the disappearances occurred mainly in the southern and central provinces and coincided with extreme violence on the part of both security forces and the JVP. The cases reported to have occurred since 11 June 1990, the date of resumption of hostilities with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have been confined primarily to the eastern and north-eastern provinces of the country. In the one case that occurred in 2003, a man was allegedly arrested by police officers and last seen by his relatives at the Watthegama Police Station in Kandy.</p><p>The Working Group undertook three field missions to Sri Lanka, in 1991, 1992 and 1999. The central recommendation to the Government was the establishment of an independent body with the task of investigating all cases of disappearance which had occurred since 1995 and to accelerate its efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. The Working Group also recommended the setting up of a central register of detainees as provided for in article 10.3 of the Declaration. It also pointed out that all families of disappeared persons should receive the same amount of compensation and that the procedure for issuing death certificates in cases of disappearances should be applied in an equitable and non-discriminatory manner. The Working Group further noted that the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Emergency Regulations had not been abolished or harmonized with internationally accepted standards of human rights, and recommended that the prohibition of enforced disappearance be included as a fundamental right in the Constitution of Sri Lanka.</p><p>According to its records, the Government has so far provided information in respect of a total of 11,655 cases.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 12,278 cases to the Government; of those, 40 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, 6,530 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 5,708 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group wishes to express its appreciation to the Government of Sri Lanka for the amount of information that it has provided and for its efforts to investigate and clarify the fate of the many thousands of persons who disappeared in the past.</p><p>The Working Group invites the Government to report on the further implementation of the recommendations emanating from the Working Group visits in 1991, 1992 and 1999.</p><h1>Sudan</h1><h1>Urgent actions</h1><p>On 6 December 2004, the Working Group transmitted the cases of 19 persons of the Fur and Dajo communities who had reportedly been arrested by armed forces and Janjaweed militia from their homes and from the streets of Adwa village north of Nyala on 28 November 2004. Reportedly, no information on the whereabouts of these persons was made available to their relatives and NGOs. Two of these disappeared persons were men aged 85 and 70 years old.</p><p>On 28 January 2005, a source informed the Working Group that on 7 January 2005, six men from the Zaghawa community, all employees of a Chinese company constructing the Hamadab Dam, were arrested by security personnel from Marawi City, Northern Province.

Reportedly, the authorities informed the relatives that he had been transferred to Nyala police station, but despite the efforts of his family and NGOs to discover his whereabouts, they remain unknown. It was further alleged that his arrest was connected to the fact that he had provided information to an NGO on the rape of three women and two girls by Janjaweed militias on 17 February 2005, near the Outash IDP camp.</p><p>It was reported that on 3 March 2005 a man was arrested by police officers in Nyala from his home on suspicion of supporting the Sudan Liberation Army. Reportedly, he was taken to police headquarters in Nyala and subjected to ill-treatment. No information on his whereabouts could be obtained from the authorities. The same report stated that on 14 March 2005, three armed men in military uniform arrested two men in Mershing village in Nyala. Since then, both men's whereabouts remain unknown. On 28 April 2005, these three cases were transmitted under the urgent action procedure to the Government of the Sudan.</p><p>On 4 May 2005, an urgent appeal was sent by the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on the cases of three persons who were reportedly singled out from among the passengers on a bus by military servicemen on 20 April 2005, beaten, and taken to an unknown location.</p><p>On 11 May 2005, the same thematic mandates sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government on the case of a 16-year-old male of the Dajo community, living at Kalma IDP camp, who was allegedly arrested on 21 April 2005 by military intelligence but could not be located after 22 April.</p><p>On 19 July 2005, an urgent appeal was sent by the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group and the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture on the cases of five persons reportedly arrested on 12 May 2005 by security forces in Hey Alkhartoum Billail, Nyala. Allegedly, relatives were denied access to these persons and they were transferred on 14 June to an unknown location.</p><h1>Information received from the Government</h1><p>On 4 August 2005, the Government reported that the three men reportedly disappeared from Marawi City on 7 January 2005 had been arrested, interrogated and released on 29 January due to lack of evidence.</p><p>On 4 August 2005, the Sudanese authorities informed the Working Group that one of the persons disappeared from a bus on 20 April (see paragraph 498) had been arrested on 18 April on charges of participating in rebel activities and that his case was still under investigation.</p><p>On 21 June 2005, the Government informed the Working Group that three of the reportedly disappeared men who were arrested on 18 April 2005 were involved in \"acts prejudicial to the national security of the State\". On 4 August 2005, the Government reiterated this information.</p><p>On 11 June 2005, the Government responded on the case of the joint urgent action on a 16-year-old boy from the Dajo community (see paragraph 499), stating that the subject was 18 years old and had been summoned for an interrogation as a witness in a criminal case under article 47 (stealing of ammunition).

The Commission reportedly received credible information that several individuals were taken away by military intelligence or security agents. While some of these individuals subsequently returned, many remain unaccounted for. Those who did return have given credible testimony of the presence of many of those missing in unofficial and secret places of detention maintained by the security apparatus in different locations in the Darfur region.</p><p>Reportedly, illegal arrest and detention of individuals appears to be common practice in operations by the State security apparatus relating to the conflict in Darfur. In many of these cases families were unaware of the arrests or of the whereabouts of family members.</p><p>Reportedly, the abduction of persons during attacks by the Janjaweed and their detention in camps operated by the Janjaweed, with the support and complicity of the government armed forces, amount to gross violations of human rights and to enforced disappearances. However, the Commission did not find any evidence that these were sufficiently widespread or systematic as to constitute a crime against humanity.</p><p>The Commission of Inquiry investigated reports of abduction of women by Janjaweed, including in Tawila, Northern Darfur, and Mallaga, Mangarsa and Kanjew in Western Darfur. Those who escaped or were eventually released were able to recount the experiences of enforced confinement, sexual slavery, rape and torture. As a general pattern, women were forcibly taken from their villages and kept at Janjaweed camps for a period of time, some times as long as three months, before they were either released or managed to escape captivity.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The majority of the 323 cases of disappearance reported in the past concerned 249 villagers who were allegedly abducted from the village of Toror in the Nuba Mountains in 1995 by the armed forces and taken to a government controlled \"peace camp\". One case concerned a member of the Communist Party of Sudan who was allegedly arrested by the security forces in Khartoum; he had reportedly been arrested four times previously and had spent a total of over two years in prison. Another 54 disappeared persons were mainly members of the Sudan Liberation Army who were allegedly arrested after clashes with government forces in Dissa and Abu Gamra in June and August 2003.

Allegedly, Lebanese citizens were illegally arrested or abducted by Syrian forces operating in Lebanon, or were handed over to Syria by Lebanese military intelligence and militias allied to Syria during the 1975-1990 civil war. After the war, many Lebanese citizens reportedly continued to be arrested in Lebanon and were illegally transferred to Syria. According to the information received, people were afraid in the past to report the disappearance of family members for fear of reprisals while Syrian forces were present in Lebanon. This information was conveyed by the Working Group to the Government under the general allegation procedure. No reply to the general allegation has been received to date from the Government.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>The majority of the cases of disappearance reported to the Working Group in the past occurred between 1980 and 1994. The security forces or military intelligence were allegedly responsible. Among the victims were students, medical doctors, military personnel and an artist. Of these, eight cases concerned Lebanese citizens, three concerned Jordanian nationals and one concerned a Palestinian. In the past, concern was expressed to the Working Group about the whereabouts of both Lebanese citizens and the Palestinian, who were reported to have disappeared in Lebanon, a circumstance for which the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic was allegedly responsible.

The Working Group also recommended that the task force further develop procedures in order to take the necessary legal steps for the clarification of all cases.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted 150 cases to the Government; of those, 1 case has been clarified on the basis of information provided by the source, 59 cases have been clarified on the basis of information provided by the Government and 90 cases remain outstanding.</p><h1>Observations</h1><p>The Working Group invites the Government of Yemen to report on further progress made on the measures agreed upon between the Government and the Working Group arising from the Working Group's 1998 field mission report.</p><h1>Zimbabwe</h1><h1>Information from the Government</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the Government regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Information from the sources</h1><p>During the period under review no information was received from the sources regarding outstanding cases.</p><h1>Summary of the situation prior to the period under review</h1><p>Of the reported cases of disappearance, one allegedly occurred in 2000 and concerned a polling officer for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change who allegedly disappeared in Bulawayo.</p><p>The two other reported cases occurred in 1986 and concerned a mother and her 2-month-old son who allegedly disappeared at the hands of persons believed to belong to the Zimbabwe African National Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and were last seen a week later at the home of the Chairman of ZANU-PF. Relatives and witnesses have allegedly been subjected to threats, intimidation and reprisals.</p><h1>Total cases transmitted, clarified and outstanding</h1><p>In the past and during the year under review, the Working Group has transmitted a total of three cases to the Government. All three cases remain outstanding.</p><p>In 2005, the Working Group transmitted 535 cases of disappearance for the first time to 22 Governments, 91 of which allegedly occurred during the last year. The Working Group used the urgent action procedure for 132 of these cases, which allegedly occurred within the three months preceding the receipt of the report by the Group. During the reporting period, the Working Group was able to clarify 1,347 cases of disappearance. The Working Group discontinued three cases. The Working Group is grateful for cooperation received from a number of Governments. The Working Group nevertheless remains gravely concerned that, of the 79 States with outstanding cases, some Governments (Burundi, Guinea, Israel, Mozambique, Namibia and Seychelles, as well as the Palestinian Authority), have never replied to the Working Group's requests for information or its reminders. Other Governments have provided pro forma responses that did not contain relevant information. The Working Group urges those Governments to fulfil their obligations under the Declaration and the resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights. The cooperation of Governments is indispensable to discovering the fate or whereabouts of disappeared persons around the globe.</p><p>The Working Group regrets that disappearances continue to occur in many different countries. While in the past the phenomenon was mainly associated with the State policies of authoritarian regimes, today it occurs in the context of more complex situations of internal conflict or tensions generating violence, humanitarian crisis, and human rights violations including enforced disappearances. This is the dramatic situation in States like Colombia, Nepal, the Russian Federation and the Sudan where the prevention of disappearances is directly connected to the resolution of internal conflicts. The Working Group's visits to Nepal in December 2004 and Colombia in June 2005 have further highlighted these concerns. The Working Group hopes that the implementation of its recommendations by these two Governments following these country visits will assist in the clarification of cases and the prevention of further disappearances. It should be noted that, in Nepal, many cases have already been clarified since the Working Group's country visit.</p><p>The Working Group remains concerned that while Africa has been racked by armed conflicts over the last decade, at the same time it is the region with the fewest reported cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances. The Working Group suspects that it is dealing with an underreported phenomenon of disappearances. Underreporting was also noted this year in the Working Group's country visit report on Colombia and it certainly exists in other countries, but the African case is particularly dramatic. The unfolding humanitarian disaster in Darfur, Sudan, is a striking, but not unique, example of this phenomenon. Underreporting is due to a combination of factors including weaknesses of civil society groups, absence of non-governmental local human rights organizations, and lack of encouragement and support, including financial support, from counterparts in the North. The Working Group is concerned that underreporting of disappearance in certain regions and countries is also due to government restrictions on, or active disruption of, civil society work on this sensitive issue.</p><p>The Working Group is particularly troubled about reports of disappearances linked to the \"war on terror\". The Working Group has noted a strong trend since 2001 whereby many States explain disappearances with reference to \"terrorists\". In some countries, authorities use the need to combat terror as a justification for repression against opposition groups. This sometimes results in disappearances. In addition, the reported use of \"extraordinary rendition\" - the sending of detainees to other countries for aggressive interrogation - and the alleged existence of secret detention centres in a number of countries is a cause of great concern to the Working Group. In the experience of the Working Group, secret detention creates situations inviting further abuse, including disappearance. The Working Group reminds all Governments that under article 7 of the Declaration, \"No circumstances whatsoever, whether a threat of war, a state of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked to justify enforced disappearances\". This includes any type of counter-terrorist campaign. The Working Group urges all Governments to comply with their obligations under international human rights and international humanitarian law, in particular under the Declaration, and to make available to families all information on the fate and whereabouts of any person who is arrested and detained, for whatever reason.</p><p>The Working Group calls upon Governments to comply with their obligations under article 10 of the Declaration. Any person deprived of liberty shall be held in an officially recognized place of detention (art. 10, para. 1), accurate information on the detention and transfer of such persons should be made promptly available to their family and counsel (art. 10, para. 2), and an official up-to-date register of detainees must be available in every place of detention (art. 10, para.</p><p>In several cases considered by the Working Group, it was noted that persons have reportedly been arrested in one country and handed over by the authorities to another country and subsequently disappeared. The Working Group wishes to remind all Governments of their obligations under article 8 of the Declaration. This article clearly affirms that no State shall expel, return (refouler) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he/she would be in danger of enforced disappearance (art. 8, para.</p><p>The Working Group is concerned that, in a number of States, legal restrictions are placed upon NGOs working on cases of disappearance. NGO workers and witnesses to disappearances are also subject to threats and harassment. The Working Group strongly urges States to allow NGOs to undertake their work freely and without impediment; to allow families of victims of disappearances to organize freely without bureaucratic restriction or legislative obstacles; and to protect witnesses.</p><p>The Working Group notes with great concern that in a number of cases children have reportedly disappeared. Although all disappearances are serious crimes, the disappearance of a child is particularly heinous. The Working Group calls on all Governments to make every effort to prevent the disappearance of children. In addition, fulfilling the mandate accorded to the Working Group by the General Assembly in resolution 59/200 and under article 20 of the Declaration, the Working Group urges Governments to address the grave situation of families, especially children, of disappeared persons. The Working Group will share information on the effects of disappearance upon children with international organizations and NGOs, urging them to provide every possible assistance to such children.</p><p>The Working Group reminds Governments that in combating disappearances effective preventive measures are crucial. Among them, the Working Group highlights the following: harmonization of domestic law with obligations of States under the Declaration and other international human rights law; accessible and updated registries of detainees; guaranteed access to appropriate information and to places of detention for relatives and lawyers of persons deprived of their liberty; strengthening of civil society organizations, especially human rights NGOs; ensuring that persons are brought before a judicial authority promptly following detention; bringing to justice all persons accused of having committed acts of enforced disappearance, ensuring that they are tried only by competent civilian courts and that they do not benefit from any special amnesty law or other similar measures likely to provide exemption from criminal proceedings or sanctions; and providing redress and adequate compensation to victims and their families.</p><p>Of course, in many cases where disappearances arise from conditions of internal conflict, the way to an enduring and sustainable solution is for the international community to take concerted action aimed at tackling the root causes that give rise to such internal situations. It is crucial that early warning indicators pointing to the occurrence of or potential for disappearances be monitored with a view to preventing this phenomenon. The Working Group is convinced that well thought-out policies and actions directed at breaking the vicious cycle of increasing poverty that gives rise to conflict are among the essential preventive measures to consider in this regard.</p><p>The preventive measures noted above are in particular aimed at democratizing the structures of governance and making human rights the cornerstone of public policy. When Governments take steps to create and support specific bodies and institutions charged with addressing disappearances, experience has demonstrated that they have highly positive results. For instance, the establishment of investigating bodies, truth commissions and war crimes tribunals are concrete actions that may lead to the clarification of cases and to the implementation of compensation policies for victims. These are strongly encouraged and supported by the Working Group, subject to the conclusions in paragraph 603 below.</p><p>A further goal of public policy must be the eradication of the culture of impunity for the perpetrators of disappearances that is found to exist in many States. The Working Group therefore wishes to stress again the importance of ending impunity for the perpetrators of enforced or involuntary disappearances. This must be understood as a crucial step, not only in the pursuit of justice but also in effective prevention. The Working Group encourages OHCHR to promote the Declaration and to include in its programme of technical cooperation the strengthening of national capacities for the prevention and eradication of disappearance.</p><p>For many years now, the creation of truth commissions and other mechanisms of peace and reconciliation, and the possibility of amnesty and pardon in a number of States have generated heated debate. The Working Group commends to the attention of all Governments and NGOs the general comment on article 18 of the Declaration contained in section II.E.2, of this report.</p><p>The Working Group has modified the structure and contents of its report to the Commission on Human Rights. The most significant contribution in this new system of reporting is in the information regarding specific countries. For the first time, a tabular summary of relevant information is provided for each State. Under the prior system, where the Working Group had not received any information regarding a particular country, the report would contain no information on that country, even though the Working Group still had outstanding cases and had written to the State concerned each year to invite information on these cases. In this year's report, the Working Group has decided to include every country that has outstanding cases before the Working Group. It is hoped that this new reporting structure will promote greater transparency and more accountability, both for States and for the Working Group itself.</p><p>Over the last two years the Working Group has benefited from enhanced and relatively stable staffing. The results speak for themselves: in one year 1,309 clarifications of cases, resolution of the huge backlog of cases from Sri Lanka, two country visits, the preparation of a general comment, the launching of a comparative study on the criminal law treatment of disappearances around the globe, and timely responses to sources and Governments. In addition, the Working Group has been able to work more effectively with other special procedures of the Commission and to act quickly in situations of urgency, both on individual cases and when threats to human rights defenders are drawn to its attention. The Working Group is grateful for the commitment to staffing as part of the process of \"regularizing\" posts now under way in the Office of the High Commissioner. It hopes that careful attention will continue to be paid to the stability of staffing for the Working Group. Finally, the Working Group must acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the members of the Secretariat, without whom little progress can be made on the mandate of the Working Group, which is to clarify the fate or whereabouts of disappeared people around the world.</p><p>At the seventy-seventh session, on 30 November 2005, the present report was adopted by the members of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances:</p><h1>Stephen J.
