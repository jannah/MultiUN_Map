        " <Sentence: In response, in his report entitled \"Investing in the United Nations: for a stronger Organization worldwide\" (A/60/692 and Corr.1), the Secretary-General set out a blueprint for comprehensive management reform which contained proposals in seven interrelated areas: people, leadership, information and communications technology, ways of delivering services, budget and finance, governance, and change management.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The present report, submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 60/260 of 8 May 2006 and 60/283 of 7 July 2006, provides details on the new human resources framework put forward in that report, particularly with respect to proposals 1 to 4, 7 and 22.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In formulating this report, the Secretary-General has taken into account the guidance given by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (see A/60/735) and by the General Assembly in section II of resolution 60/260.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The framework draws on the experience gained from previous reform efforts, a broad outreach among staff and managers throughout the Organization, consultations with staff representatives, and discussions with other organizations of the United Nations system.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: This integrated package of reforms reflects standards of global best practice and is aimed at strengthening the current and future human capital of the Organization.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: It requires investment in people and processes to ensure that the new human resources framework, building on reforms to date, will give the Organization the ability to respond effectively to the evolving requirements of Member States.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Overview Vision The Secretary-General's vision is of an independent international civil service with the highest standards of performance and accountability.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The Secretariat of the future will be an integrated, field-oriented, operational Organization.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Its multi-skilled, versatile and mobile staff will be working across disciplines to fulfil the Organization's complex and interrelated mandates in an efficient and cost-effective manner.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: It will be known for its high standards of ethics, fairness, transparency and accountability and its culture of continuous learning, high performance, managerial excellence and respect for diversity.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Headquarters and field staff will be integrated into one global Secretariat with competitive conditions of service.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: To achieve this vision, the United Nations will need to reaffirm and communicate the mission of the Organization, to strengthen the organizational culture, to renew commitment to core values and ethics and further reform its human resources management framework to meet the challenges of the future.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Reforms to date In 1997, the Secretary-General in his report entitled \"Renewing the United Nations: a programme for reform\" (A/51/950), launched a review of the management of the Organization's human resources in order to enhance its effectiveness and strengthen the international civil service.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: To this end, in 1998, he convened a Task Force on Human Resources Management, comprising experts from the public and private sectors to advise on specific measures and actions for renewal and change.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The subsequent report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly (A/53/414) drew extensively on the recommendations of the Task Force, setting out a vision of organizational change and a programme of action.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The need was recognized for a new culture of empowerment, responsibility, accountability and continuous learning.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Also stressed was the importance of a more strategic role for human resources management in the Organization in implementing organizational change.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In 2000 the Secretary-General introduced a new organizational human resources framework based on a series of building blocks for human resources management reform, which were integrated elements in the drive to improve the Organization's delivery of programmes.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The focus was on 10 key areas: human resources planning; streamlined rules and procedures; recruitment, placement and promotion; mobility; competencies and continuous learning; performance management; career development; conditions of service; contractual arrangements; and administration of justice (see A/55/253 and Corr.1).>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Since that time, significant progress has been made in bringing about the changes envisioned in these areas.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Major achievements to date include the establishment of a system of human resources planning and monitoring; the introduction of an electronic performance management system; the streamlining of rules and procedures and the launching of an electronic Human Resources Handbook; the establishment of a staff selection system which delegated the responsibility for selection decisions to department heads; the introduction of a policy on organizational mobility; the definition of organizational core values and competencies and their integration into all human resources systems.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Further details on progress made are also reported in the relevant sections of the present report and in the Secretary-General's biennial report on human resources management reform.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Also in 2000, the Secretary-General convened a high-level Panel on United Nations Peace Operations (the Brahimi Panel) to undertake a thorough review of the United Nations peace and security activities and make specific, practical recommendations for improving future activities, including on human resource management.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Building on the Panel's recommendations (see A/55/305-S/2000/809), policy guidance from the legislative bodies and the Office of Human Resources Management as well as lessons learned, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations focused its efforts on improving its ability to meet its mandate to recruit and retain high-quality civilian staff for United Nations peace operations.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Related actions included human resource requirements forecasting and targeted outreach and recruitment efforts to identify and build rosters of pre-cleared candidates available to deploy to United Nations peace operations at short notice; standardizing to the extent possible mission structures and generic job-profiling to ensure rational organizational structures that respond to mission mandates and consistent job design and classification for field missions; and efforts to put in place conditions of service that offer job security and recognize the arduous requirements of work in field operations and better enable the Organization to recruit and retain high-quality civilian personnel for United Nations peace operations.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In response to the recommendations of the Brahimi Panel and the recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit as approved by the General Assembly in resolution 58/257, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations has also examined the evolving nature of United Nations peacekeeping and its impact on human resources requirements since the early 1990s.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: That study demonstrated the need to designate 2,500 career positions for the development of a cadre of highly mobile, experienced, trained and multi-skilled civilian staff to meet the baseline human resources requirements of United Nations peace operations.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The results of the study and details of the proposed designation of those 2,500 career positions are set out in the report of the Secretary-General on the reform of the Field Service category: investing in meeting the human resources requirements of United Nations peace operations in the twenty-first century (A/61/255/Add.1).>,\n",
        " <Sentence: New challenges and the case for change Success in achieving the ambitious programme of reform set out by the Secretary-General's blueprint for change and in meeting the expectations of Member States and the world community rests, in no small measure, on the quality of the people who serve the Organization.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: To maximize the investment in people, representing 80 per cent of its resources, the United Nations requires modern, effective human resources systems and an organizational culture that enables staff at all levels throughout the Organization to contribute to their greatest potential.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Despite significant progress, the current human resources management framework, which was designed for a stable, largely Headquarters-based environment, has been only partially adapted to accommodate more dynamic field-based operations.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The Organization's increasingly complex mandates require a new skill profile to respond to needs in areas as diverse as humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping, human rights, electoral assistance, counter-terrorism and drugs and crime, in an integrated way.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The Organization needs to be able to recruit, develop and retain leaders, managers and personnel capable of handling large, complex multidisciplinary operations with increasingly high budgets.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: While the United Nations will always require specialist expertise, there is an increasing need for multi-skilled, versatile and mobile staff able to work across occupational groups to enable the Organization to respond in an integrated way to diverse new requirements.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Some 30,000 staff members are now serving in the United Nations Secretariat, of whom over half are serving in field locations (see annex I).>,\n",
        " <Sentence: While all these staff are international civil servants, they serve under several different contractual arrangements with different benefits and conditions of service.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: These arrangements evolved over time to address special situations, but no longer meet the needs of an increasingly field-based organization.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: They have become cumbersome and difficult to administer, and result in inequitable treatment of staff.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In addition, the conditions of service offered by the United Nations Secretariat to staff serving in the most difficult locations are less favourable than those offered by the funds and programmes to their staff, who increasingly work side by side with Secretariat staff.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: This is unfair and impedes the Organization's ability to attract and retain qualified staff.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The Organization's ability to respond to changing requirements is hampered by complex, outmoded and fragmented systems and processes.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Separate processes for staff in the field and headquarters duty stations, complex contractual arrangements and multiple conditions of service are confusing for staff to understand and difficult to administer.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: They also work against the development of a global integrated Secretariat.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The existing human resources information technology systems do not support the demands of a more strategic and integrated approach to human resources management.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The absence of an enterprise resource planning system has contributed to the proliferation of stand-alone human resources systems, frequently supporting similar functions and processing the same information.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Processes are often labour-intensive and still largely paper-based.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: As the systems are rarely integrated, reporting at a global level becomes a challenge, frequently necessitating manual consolidation and validation of data from the diverse systems.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The Secretary-General's ability and authority to effectively manage the Organization as chief administrative officer in accordance with Article 97 of the Charter of the United Nations are handicapped by multiple, restrictive, and often contradictory, legislative mandates.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Internal justice mechanisms are cumbersome and need to strike a proper balance between management objectives and the right of staff members to due process.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Despite the improvements introduced in recent years, the Organization's approach to recruitment is still reactive and slow; on average, 174 days elapse from the time a vacancy announcement is issued to the time a head of office selects a candidate.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Under the staff selection system, vacancies must be advertised for 60 days, limiting the ability of the Organization to recruit staff to respond promptly to the requirements of the Organization as they arise.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Large numbers of applications (more than 350,000 per year) are received from applicants, many of whom do not meet the job requirements.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Complex eligibility requirements limit staff, in particular field staff, from equal consideration for opportunities elsewhere in the Organization, prevent managers from having access to the broadest pools of talent and reinforce divisions between field and Headquarters.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Increasing staff mobility is essential to augment the Organization's flexibility, responsiveness and effectiveness.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Despite the growing global reach of the Organization, mobility of staff remains ad hoc and limited.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Occupational groups are often \"silos\" with limited opportunities for staff to cross over, even in the early stages of their careers.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Difficult and hardship duty stations often face high vacancy rates in the Professional category, thereby affecting the ability of those offices to achieve organizational mandates.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The overall vacancy rate in missions administered by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations is between 22 and 26 per cent.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: While the Organization's efforts in recruiting the highest calibre talent from around the world, particularly through the national competitive examinations, are significant, insufficient investment has been made in developing and managing that talent.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Investment in staff development remains less than 1 per cent of total staff costs.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: This is less than in the United Nations funds and programmes and far from the average of at least 4 per cent in best-practice organizations.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The Organization has put in place new leadership, management and organizational development programmes and assessment and evaluation tools.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: However, senior managers are still selected primarily on the basis of their substantive expertise or political acumen.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In some cases, senior leaders who join the Organization have had little or no prior leadership or managerial experience in a complex, multicultural environment.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The Organization can no longer afford to have leaders who are only substantive experts.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Operating in a complex, multicultural environment with increasing decentralization and delegation of authority, senior managers must be leaders of people and managers of resources, information and change.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Management capacity must be strengthened as a key underpinning of reform.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: A significant number of staff will reach retirement age over the next five years.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: For example, among approximately 7,300 Professional staff with contracts of one year or longer, 12.7 per cent will reach retirement age by 2010.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In particular, this will have an impact on the number of senior managers at the P-5 (24.2 per cent) and Director levels (37.7 per cent).>,\n",
        " <Sentence: These upcoming retirements, combined with possible buy-out options, will give the Organization the possibility to realign the workforce in line with future workforce needs.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: This situation also provides an opportunity for more proactive workforce and succession planning, and more strategic and systematic talent management.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Creation of a new human resources framework aligned to the needs of the Secretariat requires building on reforms made to date, and implementing the integrated package of proposals presented in this report.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: They must be considered in a holistic manner as they are all interrelated.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The proposals address recruitment and selection; mobility; career development and support; contractual arrangements and harmonization of conditions of service in the field; building leadership and management capacity; and limited staff buyout.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Improving the internal justice system, which is an important aspect of the reform endeavours, is being pursued through the redesign panel process mandated by the General Assembly, and will be the subject of a separate report.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The new human resources framework is based on the following principles: * Flexibility to respond to evolving organizational needs * Clear ethical standards * Simplicity, clarity and transparency * Merit-based recruitment and career development * Compliance with geographical distribution and gender balance mandates * Accountability of managers and staff * Integration of Headquarters and field staff into a global Secretariat * Strong partnerships between managers and the Office of Human Resources Management.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Consultations with staff representatives and the staff at large An extensive communication effort with respect to the new human resources management framework, directed to both management and the staff at large, has been undertaken since October 2005.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Broad outreach was carried out to solicit views and ideas from staff, managers and staff representatives through a variety of means including an e-mail to all staff requesting them to express their views on the human resources policies, regulations and rules.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: A common thread among the suggestions received was the need for equity of treatment among staff, as well as for greater transparency and accountability, and responsiveness to the needs of field operations.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Consultations were also held with interdepartmental focus groups, the United Nations funds and programmes, and in the context of the interagency Human Resources Network.>,\n",

        " <Sentence: As a result of the effort to meet the 5 per cent limit imposed by the General Assembly in resolution 59/269, recruitment efforts had to be undertaken to fill some additional 200 vacancies, because of the need to return General Service staff concerned to their parent duty stations.>,\n",

        " <Sentence: The proposal to base conditions of service on the length of continuous service rather than on the type of contractual arrangement would help ensure that staff serving in field operations would be offered the same conditions of service as those of staff serving in other duty stations.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Maintaining a multiplicity of contracts is administratively burdensome, as it requires managers to be familiar with each contractual arrangement under which staff would be appointed, administrators to apply the different sets of rules and staff members to understand the different conditions of service offered by the different sets of Staff Rules.>,\n",

        " <Sentence: At its sixty-second session, the Commission, after considering the information brought to light by the Secretary-General's report (A/60/692 and Corr.1), decided to withdraw the recommendations related to the harmonization of benefits for field staff presented in its 2005 annual report.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: It also decided to establish a working group to expedite the review of the compensation packages for internationally recruited staff serving at non-family duty stations and submit proposals for a harmonized approach within the United Nations system to the Commission at its sixty-fourth session, in March 2007.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Impact of reforms to date and rationale for change While enhancements to the compensation package for 300-series appointments of limited duration have improved conditions of service to a certain extent, they have also had the negative effect of diminishing the administrative simplicity of the 300 series.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The same administrative actions associated with the 100-series appointments are now required for the 300 series, in terms of verifying, establishing and monitoring family status and processing actions in the Integrated Management Information System.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Moreover, significant differences continue to persist in the conditions of service among staff serving in the field.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: These differences exist between staff with 300-series appointments and those with 100-series appointments, between staff with 100-series appointments who are mission appointees and those who are assigned from Headquarters and between staff serving with peace operations and those serving with the United Nations funds and programmes.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The differences relate to the designation of missions as family or non-family, the payment of compensation for maintaining a second household, the scope of the rest and recuperation scheme, the calculation of hazard pay and the lump-summing of travel entitlements.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: When a staff member serves in a non-family mission, family members are precluded from accompanying the staff member to the duty station and will need to reside elsewhere.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Consequently, the maintenance of two households in different locations constitutes a significant expense for the staff member.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Staff who are recruited for service in a non-family duty station limited to special missions receive only a base salary and a mission subsistence allowance, which is intended to cover the cost of accommodation, food and incidentals at the special mission duty station.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: There is no compensation for maintaining a separate household, and they are not entitled to payment of assignment grant, post adjustment, rental subsidy or mobility and hardship allowance.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In recent years, the United Nations funds and programmes have adopted several innovative approaches to recognize and compensate for the fact that a number of their staff members had to perform their functions in locations where they were not allowed to bring their families.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In 2000 and 2001, the funds and programmes introduced the special operations approach for situations in which staff members are appointed to duty stations at security phase III or above, where families may not join them.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Under this approach, a staff member assigned to a non-family duty station is given the option of installing his or her family in a location with appropriate facilities situated near the actual place of work (the administrative place of assignment).>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Alternatively, families can remain in the former duty station of the staff member or move to another location with entitlements based on the administrative place of assignment.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: These staff members receive salary, assignment grant, post adjustment, rental subsidy and mobility and hardship allowance at the administrative place of assignment rate and a special operations living allowance at the duty station.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Inconsistent approaches in the provision of rest breaks also serve to generate a sense of unfairness among staff from the Secretariat and from the funds and programmes working in the field.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: At present, the Secretariat provides an occasional recuperation break to international staff required to work for extended periods in locations under hazardous, stressful and difficult conditions.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The break consists of five working days of special leave at regular intervals with full pay, and does not cover any travel costs.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Requiring the entire cost of travel to be borne by the staff members limits their ability to recuperate properly.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: By contrast, the funds and programmes provide rest and recuperation breaks of five consecutive calendar days plus travel time and pay for standard travel costs between the duty station and the administrative place of assignment, in order to facilitate family visits and to provide greater relief from the hardship and isolation of the non-family duty station.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: With the high demand for peacekeeping both lasting longer and expanding beyond what was anticipated in the 1990s, there was growing dissatisfaction with the inequities between the conditions of service of staff appointed under the 300- and 100-series of staff rules.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Unequal treatment between staff from the Secretariat and staff of the funds and programmes working in the field generates a sense of unfairness and creates obstacles for the Secretariat to attract and retain staff members to perform essential functions in the field.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: As a result, United Nations peace operations face significant challenges in recruiting and retaining high-quality staff, experiencing persistently high vacancy rates that hover between 22 and 26 per cent and a turnover rate of 30 per cent for Professional posts.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: As a result, some 51 per cent of the Professional staff serving in United Nations peace operations have two years experience or less with the Organization.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: As audit reports reveal, this failure to offer job security and conditions of service that enable the Organization to sustain and develop the stable and expert workforce required to work in the uptempo, complex operational environment of United Nations field missions places our Organization at financial and managerial risk.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: If the United Nations is to become an employer of choice in today's highly competitive global market and maintain a workforce capable of meeting the challenges of increasingly complex work in the field, it needs to offer conditions of service which will attract and retain high-quality personnel.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: At present, the conditions of service offered by the Secretariat are not conducive to this vision, thus preventing the Organization from effectively managing its human resources and fully benefiting from its investment in people.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Elaboration of proposals Designating field missions in line with security phases The designation of field missions determines whether staff members may or may not be accompanied by their families at a duty station, a factor which has a powerful impact on their work and life conditions.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Currently, there are 23 missions designated \"special\" missions and seven \"established\" missions (five are peacekeeping missions and two are political missions), plus the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, and the Office of the Special Envoy for the future status process for Kosovo.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: All special missions are treated as non-family, and family members may not be installed in and live at the mission, even if the security conditions and funds and programmes would permit it.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: It is proposed that in the future, the designation of missions be in line with security considerations, as is the case at the common system level.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The classification of field duty stations as non-family or family (as opposed to \"established\" and \"special\") would be based on the security phase in effect, taking into account the size of the United Nations presence at the duty stations and relevant political, legal, practical and other logistical considerations.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Under this proposal, where a mission is classified as a family duty station, staff members may be joined at the duty station by their eligible dependants, and would be entitled to payment of post adjustment, mobility and hardship allowance, rental subsidy and related entitlements applicable to the duty station.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Introducing the special operations approach for non-family duty stations The introduction of the special operations approach for all Secretariat offices with a field presence would standardize the treatment of staff members and ensure that they receive benefits comparable or equivalent to those of the funds and programmes.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In this regard, and as indicated in paragraph 270 above, the International Civil Service Commission has established a working group to review the compensation packages for internationally recruited staff serving at non-family duty stations and submit proposals for a harmonized approach within the United Nations system to the Commission at its sixty-fourth session, in March 2007.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Therefore, the exact elements of the special operations approach will be submitted to the General Assembly at the second part of its resumed sixty-first session, in May 2007.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Currently, under the special operations approach as applied by the funds and programmes, a location near a non-family duty station with adequate medical, educational and housing facilities is designated as an administrative place of assignment.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The staff member and eligible family members are installed at the administrative place of assignment, unless the staff member elects to instal his or her family at another location.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The staff member receives the post adjustment, assignment grant and mobility and hardship allowance applicable to the administrative place of assignment duty station, as well as the special operations living allowance at the non-family duty station.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: In reviewing the compensation packages for internationally recruited staff serving at non-family duty stations, the working group will take into consideration that in some duty stations, the size of the United Nations presence, or other political, legal, security or logistical concerns, may prevent the full application of the current special operations approach.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Revising the scheme for rest breaks The Secretariat's occasional recuperation break scheme would be replaced with the rest and recuperation scheme of the funds and programmes.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Under the rest and recuperation scheme, staff would be given five calendar days of leave and travel time, and would be paid the travel costs to an approved destination or provided with United Nations transportation where available.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: For administrative simplicity, applicable travel payments would be lump-summed.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Streamlining administration, including through the use of lump-sum options The Secretariat will continue to streamline administration through the adoption of the lump-sum options wherever possible.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The practices of the United Nations funds and programmes with respect to travel and shipment will be taken into account.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Expected impact of proposals High vacancy rates and turnover rates for Professional staff in the field undermine the capacity of the Organization to carry out its mandates in the field.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The effectiveness of the Organization would be enhanced by strengthening its ability to attract and retain talent by ensuring equity and fairness in the treatment of staff and providing conditions of service that are competitive with those offered by other employers in the field.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The proposals to harmonize contractual arrangements and conditions of service would also address recommendations 3, 4 and 5 of the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on reforming the Field Service category, which called for the concept of a parent duty station to be revisited, the designation of duty stations as family and non-family to be revised and measures to be taken to alleviate the strain of field service life on individual staff members and their families.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The proposals to designate field missions in line with security phases and to introduce the special operations approach for non-family duty stations are designed to offer staff members serving in the field the opportunity for better work/life balance, which is ultimately linked to performance on the job and retention of staff.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The proposal to replace the occasional recuperation break scheme with the rest and recuperation scheme is intended not only to ensure financial parity, but to protect the health and well-being of staff members who work under hazardous and stressful conditions by providing them with the necessary opportunities for recuperation and family visits to alleviate stress, which detracts from optimum performance.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Required changes to the Staff Regulations and Rules The introduction of the special operations approach would require the replacement of staff rule 103.21 on salary and allowances during mission assignments with a new staff rule elaborating conditions of service for non-family duty stations.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Impact of proposals on the role and authority of the central human resources function The Office of Human Resources Management, on behalf of the Secretary-General, would continue to be responsible for determining the status of field duty stations in consultation with the relevant departments and offices, including the Department of Safety and Security and the Department of Peacekeeping Operations.>,\n",

        " <Sentence: The review will be based mainly on the security phase in effect but will also take into consideration the housing, medical and other facilities available at the duty station.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: For planning purposes, it is anticipated that 7 of the current 23 non-family \"special\" missions could be converted to family status.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The financial implications are estimated at $9.9 million per year (approximately $5.1 million from the budget of the affected peacekeeping operations and $4.8 million under the provisions for special political missions under the political affairs section of the programme budget).>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Introduction of the special operations approach The introduction of the special operations approach for non-family duty stations, or a modified approach, would standardize the treatment of staff members and ensure that they received benefits comparable or equivalent to those of the funds and programmes.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: The International Civil Service Commission has formed a working group to review the compensation packages for internationally recruited staff serving at non-family duty stations and submit its proposals for a harmonized approach within the United Nations system to the Commission at its sixty-fourth session, in March 2007.>,\n",
        " <Sentence: Preliminary indications are that the financial implications of introducing the special operations approach, or a modified approach, could be estimated at (a) $228 million per year for staff in field missions ($194 million for Department of Peacekeeping Operations missions from the peacekeeping budget and $34 million for special political missions from the regular budget) and (b) $701,000 per year from extrabudgetary resources.>,\n",
