If we submit \"jobs\" to different threads, those jobs can be pictured as \"sub-tasks\" of a single process and those threads will usually have access to the same memory areas (i.e., shared memory). This approach can easily lead to conflicts in case of improper  synchronization, for example, if processes are writing to the same memory location at the same time.  \n",
